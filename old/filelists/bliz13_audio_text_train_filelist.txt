../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-132.wav|for though lady bertram rather shone in the epistolary line , having early in her marriage , from the want of other employment , and the circumstance of sir thomas 's being in parliament , got into the way of making and keeping correspondents , and formed for herself a very creditable , commonplace , amplifying style , so that a very little matter was enough for her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-078.wav|they reached mansfield on thursday , and it was not till sunday evening that edmund began to talk to her on the subject .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-118.wav|missus norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might depend on , when she was stopped by sir thomas 's saying with authority , i do not advise your going to brighton , william , as i trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting ; but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere ; and you will find mister rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-27-18.wav|they examined us carefully . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-047.wav|it is disgraceful to us if it does . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-17-07.wav|we stopped two or three days at this place and then returned home . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-22-08.wav|it was some time before he came . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-117.wav|but , alas ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-010.wav|nothing was fixed on ; but henry crawford was full of ideas and projects , and generally speaking , whatever he proposed was immediately approved , first by her , and then by mister rushworth , whose principal business seemed to be to hear the others , and who scarcely risked an original thought of his own beyond a wish that they had seen his friend smith 's place . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-098.wav|but with you , fanny , there may be peace . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-04-093.wav|my dear brother , i will not believe this of you . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-29-57.wav|he had two churches a good way apart , and a great deal of work , but he never scolded or whipped me for not going faster . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-110.wav|never had she felt such a one as this letter contained . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-166.wav|what i advise is that your father be quiet . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-020.wav|they entered . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-29-05.wav|at any rate , they think that if only they pay for it a horse is bound to go just as far and just as fast , and with just as heavy a load as they please . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-034.wav|and she so little understood her own claims as to think that if mister crawford had not asked her , she must have been the last to be sought after , and should have received a partner only through a series of inquiry and bustle , and interference , which would have been terrible . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-018.wav|compared with you , who has a right to be happy ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-198.wav|this was an order to be most joyfully obeyed ; this was an act of kindness which fanny felt at her heart . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-120.wav|the families would never be connected if you did not connect them ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-083.wav|and as edmund was come on the very same business that had brought miss crawford , consciousness and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in them . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-118.wav|she was obliged to call herself to think of it , and acknowledge it to be terrible and grievous , or it was escaping her in the midst of all the agitating pressing joyful cares attending this summons to herself . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-38-22.wav|i have not much time to spare , but i can wait till you have done , and set your little girl safe on the pavement . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-054.wav|how beautiful , how welcome , how wonderful the evergreen ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-048.wav|it is a mistake , sir , said fanny instantly ; it must be a mistake , it can not be true ; it must mean some other people . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-106.wav|i should not wonder if he is not more than five foot eight . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-039.wav|he tried to console her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-09-025.wav|what a difference a vowel makes ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-17-087.wav|when he returned from richmond , he would have been glad to see missus rushworth no more . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-191.wav|the state of her spirits had probably had its share in her indisposition ; for she had been feeling neglected , and been struggling against discontent and envy for some days past . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-124.wav|i know nothing of the miss owens , said fanny calmly . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-181.wav|do you think we are walking four miles an hour ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-062.wav|i do not catch your meaning , said sir thomas , sitting down again . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-11-085.wav|he pressed her hand , looked at her , and was gone . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-12-053.wav|mister rushworth has set a good example , and such things are very catching . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-037.wav|she is gone out of harbor already three days before we had any thought of it ; and i do not know what i am to do about sam's things , they will never be ready in time ; for she may have her orders tomorrow , perhaps . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-14-27.wav|how old are you , james ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-011.wav|but why would not you let us come for you ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-035.wav|yes , i believe we were ; but i have not the least recollection at what . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-104.wav|i only puzzle them , and oblige them to make civil speeches . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-107.wav|william was soon calling out from the landing place of the second story for his mother and for rebecca . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-36-28.wav|why , my dear , mister briggs wants me to take missus briggs to church every sunday morning . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-207.wav|fanny's last feeling in the visit was disappointment : for the shawl which edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round her shoulders was seized by mister crawford's quicker hand , and she was obliged to be indebted to his more prominent attention . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-11-19.wav|and do you think , said master sternly , that treatment like this will make him fond of your will ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-122.wav|she had not time to be miserable . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-087.wav|the subject is more justly considered . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-08-098.wav|but her only offer of exchange was addressed to miss crawford , as they gained the summit of a long hill , and was not more inviting than this . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-08-051.wav|his conviction of her regard for him was sometimes very strong ; he could look back on a long course of encouragement , and she was as perfect in disinterested attachment as in everything else . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-116.wav|who have they got to meet us ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-127.wav|men love to distinguish themselves , and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained , but not in the church . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-012.wav|the value of an event on a wet day in the country was most forcibly brought before her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-08-075.wav|and as she spoke , she was undoing a small parcel , which fanny had observed in her hand when they met . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-060.wav|i do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-045.wav|he will be taken in at last . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-35-51.wav|just then the cart in front of us began to move on , and then we had a good turn . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-015.wav|he came to her , sat down by her , took her hand , and pressed it kindly ; and at that moment she thought that , but for the occupation and the scene which the tea things afforded , she must have betrayed her emotion in some unpardonable excess . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-05-43.wav|james howard , the stable boy , was just as gentle and pleasant in his way , so i thought myself well off . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-17-043.wav|i rather wonder julia is not in love with henry , was her observation to mary . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-01-091.wav|poor mister norris's indifferent state of health made it an impossibility . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-010.wav|as a sister , so partial and so angry and so little scrupulous of what she said , and in another light so triumphant and secure , she was in every way an object of painful alarm . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-12-020.wav|and had her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise of it in every other respect , had she been sure that she was seeing clearly , and judging candidly , she would probably have made some important communications to her usual confidant . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-02-012.wav|there was one person , however , in the house , whom he could not leave to learn his sentiments merely through his conduct . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-32-09.wav|there was a great deal of bargaining , of running up and beating down ; and if a horse may speak his mind so far as he understands , i should say there were more lies told and more trickery at that horse fair , than a clever man could give an account of . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-011.wav|and to poor miss crawford , who had just been contemplating the dismal rain in a very desponding state of mind , sighing over the ruin of all her plan of exercise for that morning , and of every chance of seeing a single creature beyond themselves , for the next twenty-four hours , the sound of a little bustle at the front door and the sight of miss price , dripping with wet in the vestibule , was delightful . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-35-12.wav|he could not bear any careless loitering and waste of time ; and nothing was so near making him angry as to find people , who were always late , wanting a cab horse to be driven hard , to make up for their idleness . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-19-27.wav|and which does the most mischief heaven only knows . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-09-010.wav|we seemed very glad to see each other , and i do really think we were a little . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-125.wav|maria gave edmund a glance , which meant , what say you now ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-17-014.wav|oh , very well ; and not another word was said ; but fanny felt herself again in danger , and her indifference to the danger was beginning to fail her already . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-26-35.wav|then followed a conversation between them , till it was agreed that robert , as the groom , should lead me , and that ned must take the body . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-41-36.wav|there was an old man , too , who used to come up our street with a little coal cart ; he wore a coal-heaver's hat , and looked rough and black . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-077.wav|even your constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-38-51.wav|after this we continued our journey , and as they got out of the cab our friend was saying , my doctrine is this , that if we see cruelty or wrong that we have the power to stop , and do nothing , we make ourselves sharers in the guilt . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-131.wav|whatever cross-accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces , she had found a morning of complete enjoyment .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-11-084.wav|he could say no more , for fanny would be no longer detained . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-059.wav|so often as she had heard them wish for a ball at home as the greatest of all felicities ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-19-06.wav|i felt very faint after it and thought i should die , and i believe they all thought so too . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-26-42.wav|i am sure he was sorry for me , for he often patted and encouraged me , talking to me in a pleasant voice . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-45-66.wav|while harry was sponging off the mud from hotspur's body and legs , dolly came in , looking very full of something . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-184.wav|she could but just speak to be heard , and she said so prettily , let sister susan have my knife , mama , when i am dead and buried . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-136.wav|why can not you come and sit here , and employ yourself as we do ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-032.wav|i dare say that on a comparison of our opinions , they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be : to the point , i consider crawford's proposals as most advantageous and desirable , if you could return his affection . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-055.wav|have you ever happened to look at the part i mean , continued miss crawford , opening her book . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-47-53.wav|upon this advice skinner , rather unwillingly , i think , gave orders that i should be well fed and cared for , and the stable man , happily for me , carried out the orders with a much better will than his master had in giving them . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-17-12.wav|why , he's a child ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-070.wav|she seldom saw him : never alone . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-129.wav|yet she thought it would not have been so at mansfield . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-48-19.wav|poor old fellow , see , grandpapa , how well he understands kindness . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-027.wav|you are to deal , ma'am ; shall i deal for you ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-158.wav|and fanny had barely time for an unpleasant feeling on the occasion , when missus grant , with sudden recollection , turned to her , and asked for the pleasure of her company too . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-086.wav|her talents will be wanted in amelia . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-26-45.wav|the next day after the farrier had examined my wounds , he said he hoped the joint was not injured ; and if so , i should not be spoiled for work , but i should never lose the blemish . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-161.wav|sir thomas found it expedient to go to antigua himself , for the better arrangement of his affairs , and he took his eldest son with him , in the hope of detaching him from some bad connexions at home . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-43-51.wav|all right , gentlemen , pray stay in as long as it suits you ; i can wait while you rest yourselves . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-193.wav|that she should be tired now , however , gives me no surprise ; for there is nothing in the course of one 's duties so fatiguing , as what we have been doing this morning : seeing a great house , dawdling from one room to another , straining one 's eyes and one's attention , hearing what one does not understand , admiring what one does not care for . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-29-44.wav|it was very unpleasant for any horse who pulled with her , and made me quite fidgety . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-030.wav|south or north , i know a black cloud when i see it ; and you must not set forward while it is so threatening . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-212.wav|it was plain that he could have no serious views , no true attachment , by fixing himself in a situation which he must know she would never stoop to . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-152.wav|i told her so . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-45-12.wav|the clock chimed the quarters , one , two , three , and then struck twelve , but the door did not open . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-19-14.wav|he says he knows it was all his fault , though he is sure he did the best he knew , and he says if beauty dies no one will ever speak to him again . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-084.wav|he was the sort of young man to be generally liked . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-14-024.wav|her aunt often expressed a wish for her , but there was no notice , no message from the uncle on whom all depended .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-09-006.wav|you will find the beginning of a note to yourself ; but i can now speak my business , which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle , a chain for william 's cross .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-004.wav|she listened , and at length she heard ; she heard voices and feet approaching ; but she had just satisfied herself that it was not those she wanted , when miss bertram , mister rushworth , and mister crawford issued from the same path which she had trod herself , and were before her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-33-47.wav|in a short time i and my master understood each other as well as horse and man can do . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-40-33.wav|the sight was too dreadful . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-093.wav|and he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by fanny . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-32-17.wav|he was not a gentleman , nor yet one of the loud , flashy sort that call themselves so . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-14-071.wav|poor sir thomas will feel it dreadfully . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-04-071.wav|the meeting was very satisfactory on each side . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-089.wav|and besides , there is more general observation and taste , a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly ; in every congregation , there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter , and who can judge and criticise . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-045.wav|but no matter ; here 's fanny in the parlor , and why should we stay in the passage ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-101.wav|i am very glad that you have heard of it , by whatever means , and i hope there will be no farther delay .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-056.wav|even now , she speaks with pleasure of being in mansfield in june ; but june is at a great distance , and i believe i shall write to her .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-14-104.wav|it would really be gratifying to see them all again , and a little addition of society might be of infinite use to them ; and as to you yourself , you must feel yourself to be so wanted there , that you can not in conscience , conscientious as you are , keep away when you have the means of returning .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-01-13.wav|as soon as i was old enough to eat grass my mother used to go out to work in the daytime , and come back in the evening .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-196.wav|her feelings were all in revolt . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-08-073.wav|the next meeting of the two mansfield families produced another alteration in the plan , and one that was admitted with general approbation . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-066.wav|in a general light , private theatricals are open to some objections , but as we are circumstanced , i must think it would be highly injudicious , and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-042.wav|so thought fanny in good truth and sober sadness , as she sat musing over that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs : wondering at the past and present ; wondering at what was yet to come , and in a nervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of her being never under any circumstances able to love mister crawford , and the felicity of having a fire to sit over , and think of it .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-16-53.wav|we , however , were taken in and well done by . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-35-04.wav|he was kind and good , and as strong for the right as john manly ; and so good-tempered and merry that very few people could pick a quarrel with him . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-43-04.wav|first came a stout puffy gentleman with a carpet bag . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-39-48.wav|the next morning the same man came again . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-08-089.wav|that was the only point of resemblance between her and the lady who sat by her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-11-032.wav|my uncle talked of two months ; i suppose it will not be less .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-17-47.wav|he was a nice little bright fellow , and always came whistling to his work . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-037.wav|i thought you were against me ; this is such a comfort ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-036.wav|i am going to live entirely with my aunt norris . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-157.wav|her year , cried missus price ; i am sure i hope i shall be rid of her before she has staid a year , for that will not be up till november . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-118.wav|and you know it makes very little difference to sir thomas . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-075.wav|there , let them lie just before you . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-093.wav|in watching them she forgot herself ; and agitated by the increasing spirit of edmund's manner , had once closed the page and turned away exactly as he wanted help . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-16-59.wav|then the under hostler said he had asked dick to go up the ladder to put down some hay , but told him to lay down his pipe first . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-32-31.wav|say twenty-five and you shall have him . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-085.wav|but as they are before me ; and had i a place of my own in the country , i should be most thankful to any mister repton who would undertake it , and give me as much beauty as he could for my money ; and i should never look at it till it was complete . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-075.wav|fanny was silent , and miss crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness , till suddenly looking up at the end of a few minutes , she exclaimed , ah , here he is . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-002.wav|miss crawford accepted the part very readily ; and soon after miss bertram 's return from the parsonage , mister rushworth arrived , and another character was consequently cast . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-073.wav|i mean when you are settled there ; i do indeed ; i think you will fit up a theater at your house in norfolk . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-006.wav|the being left with her sister and nephew , and all the house under her care had been an advantage entirely thrown away ; she had been unable to direct or dictate , or even fancy herself useful . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-039.wav|i am sure miss bertram is very much attached to mister rushworth . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-170.wav|it was more pleasant than prudent . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-26-51.wav|everybody pitied susan ; she was nearly out of her mind . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-46-19.wav|yes , yes , too heavy , he said ; but that's not my fault ; the foreman came just as we were starting , and would have three hundredweight more put on to save him trouble , and i must get on with it as well as i can . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-050.wav|his acting had first taught fanny what pleasure a play might give , and his reading brought all his acting before her again ; nay , perhaps with greater enjoyment , for it came unexpectedly and with no such drawback , as she had been used to suffer in seeing him on the stage with miss bertram . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-21-03.wav|i had now lived in this happy place three years , but sad changes were about to come over us . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-32-23.wav|i was dreadfully afraid he would have me , but he walked off . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-44-15.wav|the farrier and jerry did the best they could to ease his pain and make him comfortable . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-04-44.wav|john does all he can to please her , and james does all he can , and our master never uses a whip if a horse acts right ; so i think she might be good-tempered here . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-089.wav|i wish you may not be fatigued by so much exercise . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-028.wav|well , and if they were ten , cried missus norris , i am sure you need not regard it . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-040.wav|oh , quite enough , cried mister yates , with only just a side wing or two run up , doors in flat , and three or four scenes to be let down ; nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-108.wav|we must go out on the lawn for that .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-103.wav|you taught me to think and feel on the subject , cousin . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-12-032.wav|he will see the rushworths , which own i am not sorry for , having a little curiosity , and so i think has he though he will not acknowledge it . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-18-20.wav|the air was frosty , the moon was bright ; it was very pleasant .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-075.wav|i can think only of the friends i am leaving : my excellent sister , yourself , and the bertrams in general . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-48-07.wav|some of them looked as if poverty and hard times had hardened them all over ; but there were others that i would have willingly used the last of my strength in serving ; poor and shabby , but kind and human , with voices that i could trust . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-146.wav|fanny answered for their having breakfasted , and being quite ready in half an hour .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-017.wav|he had been apt to gain hearts too easily . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-103.wav|my dear fanny , replied edmund , scarcely hearing her to the end , let us not , any of us , be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-17-014.wav|julia's match became a less desperate business than he had considered it at first . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-40-15.wav|and so at last , said she , i was bought by a man who keeps a number of cabs and horses , and lets them out . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-136.wav|we were going through the three first acts , and not unsuccessfully upon the whole . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-01-106.wav|should her disposition be really bad , said sir thomas , we must not , for our own children's sake , continue her in the family ; but there is no reason to expect so great an evil . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-071.wav|oh , it does not signify . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-09-27.wav|he said they were only fit for drovers or gypsies , and not for young gentlemen . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-106.wav|you would find it difficult , i dare say , just now , in the middle of a very late hay harvest , to hire a horse and cart ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-12-43.wav|it grew darker and darker , stiller and stiller . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-111.wav|but we have no such people in mansfield . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-084.wav|he too had his book , and was seeking fanny to ask her to rehearse with him , and help him to prepare for the evening , without knowing miss crawford to be in the house . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-08-26.wav|this man was as hard-tempered and hard-handed as samson ; he always spoke in a rough , impatient voice , and if i did not move in the stall the moment he wanted me , he would hit me above the hocks with his stable broom or the fork , whichever he might have in his hand . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-02-03.wav|i was two years old when a circumstance happened which i have never forgotten . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-41-17.wav|if you were not my own son i would dismiss you on the spot ; it is a disgrace to have a horse brought to the shop in a condition like that ; you are liable to be taken up by the police for such driving , and if you are , you need not look to me for bail , for i have spoken to you till i am tired ; you must look out for yourself . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-12-53.wav|oh ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-188.wav|i had attributed them to you before . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-01-08.wav|some shady trees leaned over it , and rushes and water-lilies grew at the deep end . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-114.wav|and fanny , though almost totally separated from her family , was sensible of the truest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them , or of anything at all promising in their situation or conduct . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-08-008.wav|the fatigue would be too much for your aunt . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-19-32.wav|a woman should not undertake to nurse a tender little child without knowing what is good and what is bad for it . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-07-39.wav|i felt hungry , for i had not eaten since the early morning , but there was not enough grass in that meadow for a goose to live on . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-17-074.wav|the sister with whom she was used to be on easy terms was now become her greatest enemy : they were alienated from each other and julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to the attentions which were still carrying on there , some punishment to maria for conduct so shameful towards herself , as well as towards mister rushworth . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-01-033.wav|it reestablished peace and kindness . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-101.wav|when you have studied the character , i am sure you will feel it suit you . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-084.wav|it was all known at the parsonage , where he loved to talk over the future with both his sisters , and it would be rather gratifying to him to have enlightened witnesses of the progress of his success . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-38-10.wav|one mile of such traveling , with a weight to draw and no firm footing , would take more out of us than four on a good road ; every nerve and muscle of our bodies is on the strain to keep our balance ; and added to this , the fear of falling is more exhausting than anything else . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-12-052.wav|he acknowledged no such inducement and his sister ought to have given him credit , for better feelings than her own . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-130.wav|such a look of reproach at edmund from his father , she could never have expected to witness ; and to feel that it was in any degree deserved was an aggravation indeed . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-010.wav|he wondered that fanny spoke so seldom of her , and had so little voluntarily to say of her concern at this separation . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-030.wav|do you suppose that we think differently ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-08-096.wav|you must think of henry , for it was his choice in the first place . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-04-21.wav|he turned round as far as his halter would allow , held up his head , and said , my name is merrylegs . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-115.wav|but there is no escaping these little vexations , mary , live , where we may . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-09-08.wav|i asked . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-29-46.wav|ah , she said in a troubled manner , i know my paces are very bad , but what can i do ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-06-010.wav|no , no ; you ought to be satisfied with her two cousins . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-070.wav|i can not suppose that you have not the wish to love him , the natural wish of gratitude . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-173.wav|it is no reflection on you ; it is no more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced , more or less , in their time . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-211.wav|but she would now meet him with his own cool feelings . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-10-28.wav|said the old horse with a stamp of his foot ; for fashion ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-08-40.wav|well , my pretty one , well , how do things go with you now ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-038.wav|here was again a want of delicacy and regard for others , which had formerly so struck and disgusted her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-043.wav|there would not be time , and other difficulties would arise . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-12-066.wav|fanny could listen no farther . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-05-18.wav|i just held the rein steady and did not hurry him , and it's my opinion he has not been frightened or ill-used while he was young . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-048.wav|he inquired next after her family , especially william : and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little , and thinking his return a misfortune ; and when , on having courage to lift her eyes to his face , she saw that he was grown thinner , and had the burnt , fagged , worn look of fatigue and a hot climate , every tender feeling was increased , and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-24-85.wav|i shook him as little as i could help , but once or twice on the rough ground he called out , steady , woah , steady ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-050.wav|well , fanny , it is all happily settled , and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle's side . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-01-39.wav|this is not the first time , nor the second , but it shall be the last . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-04-030.wav|this third he resolved to exchange for one that his cousin might ride ; he knew where such a one was to be met with ; and having once made up his mind , the whole business was soon completed . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-048.wav|poor dears , how tired you must both be ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-088.wav|yes , added the other ; and of the roman emperors as low as severus ; besides a great deal of the heathen mythology and all the metals , semi-metals , planets , and distinguished philosophers . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-17-032.wav|she could almost think anything would have been preferable to this .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-097.wav|for this letter she must try to arm herself . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-48-22.wav|well , grandpapa , i don't believe that this one is old ; look at his mane and tail . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-122.wav|now , mister bertram , if you write to your brother , i entreat you to tell him that my harp is come . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-04-088.wav|if you can persuade henry to marry , you must have the address of a frenchwoman . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-209.wav|edmund urged her remaining where she was with an earnestness , with which she could not resist , and she was left on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin's care , but with great regret that she was not stronger . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-087.wav|why , fanny , you are absolutely in a reverie . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-169.wav|fanny had been everywhere awake to the difference of the country since february ; but when they entered the park her perceptions and her pleasures were of the keenest sort . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-12-065.wav|from my soul i do not think she would marry you without love ; that is , if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition , i can not suppose it her ; but ask her to love you , and she will never have the heart to refuse . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-204.wav|you should always remember the coachman and horses . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-060.wav|for lady bertram never thought of being useful to anybody , and missus norris , when she came on the morrow , in consequence of an early call and invitation from sir thomas , was in a very ill humor , and seemed intent only on lessening her niece's pleasure , both present and future , as much as possible . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-002.wav|the ball was over and the breakfast was soon over too ; the last kiss was given and william was gone . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-011.wav|so far from being all satisfied and all enjoying , she found everybody requiring something they had not , and giving occasion of discontent to the others .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-23-14.wav|one of the footmen ran for the winch , and another brought a knife from the house . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-09-025.wav|my dear fanny , you feel these things a great deal too much .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-17-038.wav|she either sat in gloomy silence , wrapt in such gravity as nothing could subdue , no curiosity touch , no wit amuse ; or allowing the attentions of mister yates , was talking with forced gaiety to him alone , and ridiculing the acting of the others .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-173.wav|it was her own knife ; little sister mary had left it to her upon her deathbed , and she ought to have had it to keep herself long ago .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-007.wav|fanny had hoped , in the course of his yesterday's visit , to hear the day named ; but he had only spoken of their journey , as what would take place ere long . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-12-26.wav|there's something wrong , sir , said john , and he sprang out of the dog-cart and came to my head and looked all about . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-30-41.wav|five or six mornings after this , just as the boy had left the stable , the door was pushed open , and a policeman walked in , holding the child tight by the arm ; another policeman followed and locked the door on the inside saying , show me the place where your father keeps his rabbits' food . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-46-54.wav|i believe , had i stayed there very long , i should have become purblind , and that would have been a great misfortune , for i have heard men say that a stone-blind horse was safer to drive , than one which had imperfect sight , as it generally makes them very timid .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-161.wav|he had been most anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible , but it would not do ; he must give it up .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-015.wav|missus norris gave the particulars of the letters , and the subject was dropped ; but after tea , as miss crawford was standing at an open window with edmund and fanny looking out on a twilight scene , while the miss bertrams , mister rushworth , and henry crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte , she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group , and saying , how happy mister rushworth looks ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-058.wav|and her thoughts flew to those absent cousins , with most unfeigned and truly tender regret , that they were not at home to take their own place in the room , and have their share of a pleasure which would have been so very delightful to them .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-075.wav|edmund was close to her ; he was speaking to her ; he was evidently directing her management of the bridle ; he had hold of her hand ; she saw it , or the imagination supplied what the eye could not reach .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-47-42.wav|i can not tell how long i lay there , but i found my life coming back , and a kind-voiced man was patting me , and encouraging me to rise .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-175.wav|besides , there was gratitude towards her , for having made their tete-a-tete so much less painful than her fears had predicted . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-05-17.wav|they were shooting rabbits near the highwood , and a gun went off close by ; he pulled up a little and looked , but did not stir a step to right or left .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-136.wav|i did not see her again for a twelvemonth . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-173.wav|after repeating this , edmund was so much affected , that fanny , watching him with silent but most tender concern , was almost sorry that the subject had been entered on at all . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-12-074.wav|they had need be all in love , to find any amusement in such folly ; and so they are , i fancy .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-017.wav|it was beginning to look brighter when fanny , observing a harp in the room , asked some questions about it , which soon led to an acknowledgment of her wishing very much to hear it , and a confession , which could hardly be believed , of her having never yet heard it since its being in mansfield . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-06-033.wav|is she prudish ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-11-047.wav|you know all that would be felt on the occasion .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-143.wav|when mansfield was considered , time was precious . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-29-10.wav|oh , he's used to it ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-09-36.wav|through his nose , as he used to do in the morning when he heard james' footstep at the door . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-101.wav|fanny would hardly even speak her agreement . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-191.wav|and turning to his uncle who was now close to them , is not fanny a very good dancer , sir ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-31-38.wav|i was therefore kept till my feet were quite sound , and then , i was sold again . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-33-46.wav|he soon found out that i was willing to work and do my best , and he never laid the whip on me , unless it was gently drawing the end of it over my back when i was to go on ; but generally i knew this well by the way in which he took up the reins , and i believe his whip was more often stuck up by his side than in his hand . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-017.wav|this will never do , said tom bertram at last . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-091.wav|and remember that if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves , you should always be modest ; for much as you know already , there is a great deal more for you to learn .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-135.wav|she fancied he was trying for it the whole evening at intervals , whenever sir thomas was out of the room or at all engaged with missus norris , and she carefully refused him every opportunity . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-049.wav|sir thomas was indeed the life of the party , who at his suggestion now seated themselves round the fire . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-39-22.wav|that was sixpence , and the fare one and sixpence ; then i got a return for a shilling . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-49-43.wav|i soon found that she was a good driver , and she seemed pleased with my paces . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-109.wav|but if she could undertake the part , we must not be surprised at the rest . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-24-105.wav|i found by their conversation that my young mistress was now out of danger , and would soon be able to ride again . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-05-45.wav|a few days after this i had to go out with ginger in the carriage . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-10-53.wav|this wise speech of good little merrylegs , which we knew was quite true , cooled us all down , especially sir oliver , who was dearly fond of his master ; and to turn the subject i said , can any one tell me the use of blinkers ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-07-50.wav|it was a bad business , a bad business ; then he quietly took the rein and led me to the stable ; just at the door stood samson . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-044.wav|talking does no good . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-10-026.wav|after talking a little more about mansfield , a subject in which her interest was most apparent , crawford began to hint at the expediency of an early walk . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-07-36.wav|i heard him fall heavily on the turf , and without looking behind me , i galloped off to the other end of the field ; there i turned around and saw my persecutor slowly rising from the ground and going into the stable . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-32-48.wav|now , then , harry , my boy , open the gates , and mother will bring us the lantern . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-02-21.wav|i said . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-043.wav|but her heart was so full and her senses still so astonished , that she could listen but imperfectly even to what he told her of william , and saying only when he paused , how kind , how very kind ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-123.wav|this was , in fact , the origin of our acting , said tom , after a moment 's thought . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-018.wav|i had every attention from the frasers that could be reasonably expected . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-112.wav|sir thomas told me ten pounds would be enough . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-09-063.wav|by sitting together upstairs , they avoided a great deal of the disturbance of the house ; fanny had peace , and susan learned to think it no misfortune to be quietly employed . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-12-056.wav|at length , a something like composure succeeded . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-133.wav|is there anything in my present entreaty that you do not understand ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-09-039.wav|the first solid consolation which fanny received for the evils of home , the first which her judgment could entirely approve and which gave any promise of durability , was in a better knowledge of susan , and a hope of being of service to her .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-044.wav|but , by god , if she belonged to me , i'd give her the rope's end as long as i could stand over her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-12-085.wav|a pretty modest request upon my word , he indignantly exclaimed as they walked away . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-34-30.wav|i loved to feel his hand on my neck , and arched my chest proudly and happily ; but i stood very still , for i knew all his moods , and when he liked me to be quiet , and when gay .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-122.wav|in all the important preparations of the mind she was complete : being prepared for matrimony by an hatred of home , restraint , and tranquillity ; by the misery of disappointed affection , and contempt of the man she was to marry . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-195.wav|i only said in reply that from my heart , i wished her well , and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly , and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire , the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty , to the lessons of affliction , and immediately left the room . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-01-35.wav|as soon as we saw the master we trotted up nearer to see what went on . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-29-59.wav|i only wish i was with him now ; but he had to leave and go to a large town , and then i was sold to a farmer . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-003.wav|under his government , mansfield was an altered place .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-05-50.wav|after we had been out two or three times together we grew quite friendly and sociable , which made me feel very much at home .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-018.wav|after all that i said to her as we came along , i thought she would have behaved better ; i told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-058.wav|i beg your pardon , but i can not quite believe you . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-26-47.wav|proud flesh , as they called it , came up in my knees , and was burned out with caustic ; and when at last it was healed , they put a blistering fluid over the front of both knees , to bring all the hair off ; they had some reason for this , and i suppose it was all right . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-078.wav|i wish i had settled with missus fraser not to go to her till after easter , a much better time for the visit , but now i can not put her off .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-141.wav|how may my honesty at least rise to any distinction ?

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-141.wav|we shall greatly miss edmund in our small circle , but i trust and hope he will find the poor invalid in a less alarming state , than might be apprehended , and that he will be able to bring him to mansfield shortly , which sir thomas proposes should be done , and thinks best on every account , and i flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able to bear the removal without material inconvenience or injury . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-022.wav|as well as i can recollect , it was always much the same . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-018.wav|do you think so , said fanny . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-018.wav|her habits of ready submission , on the contrary , made her almost instantly rise and lead the way out of the room . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-090.wav|i had my choice of the parts , said mister rushworth ; but i thought i should like the count best , though i do not much relish the finery i am to have .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-09-061.wav|her greatest wonder on the subject soon became not that susan should have been provoked into disrespect and impatience against her better knowledge , but that so much better knowledge , so many good notions should have been hers at all ; and that , brought up in the midst of negligence and error , she should have formed such proper opinions of what ought to be ; she , who had had no cousin edmund to direct her thoughts or fix her principles . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-034.wav|but this must be learned to be endured . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-093.wav|her behavior to mister rushworth was careless and cold .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-35-49.wav|i'll do all that can be done , sir , said jerry ; i think we shall be in time . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-141.wav|then turning away towards any or all of the rest , he tranquilly said , mister and miss crawford were mentioned in my last letters from mansfield .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-215.wav|he submitted to believe that tom 's illness had influenced her , only reserving for himself this consoling thought , that considering the many counteractions of opposing habits , she had certainly been more attached to him , than could have been expected , and for his sake , been more near doing right . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-048.wav|at any rate , it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such subjects . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-022.wav|she said nothing , however , but , sad , sad girl ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-10-007.wav|good sense like hers will always act when really called upon ; and she found that she had been able to name him to her mother , and recall her remembrance of the name as that of william's friend , though she could not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable at such a moment . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-135.wav|you assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given , or than i can quite comprehend .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-17-029.wav|he feared that principle , active principle , had been wanting ; that they had never been properly taught to govern their inclinations and tempers , by that sense of duty , which can alone suffice .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-013.wav|to see the expression of her eyes , the change of her complexion , the progress of her feelings , their doubt , confusion , and felicity , was enough . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-114.wav|it is amazing , said she , how much young people cost their friends , what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-137.wav|you shook your head at my acknowledging that i should not like to engage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-139.wav|you , are speaking of london , i , am speaking of the nation at large . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-102.wav|she was a woman who spent her days in sitting nicely dressed on a sofa , doing some long piece of needlework , of little use , and no beauty , thinking more of her pug than her children , but very indulgent to the latter , when it did not put herself to inconvenience , guided in everything important by sir thomas , and in smaller concerns by her sister . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-08-037.wav|to her the cares were sometimes almost beyond the happiness ; for young and inexperienced , with small means of choice and no confidence in her own taste , the how she should be dressed was a point of painful solicitude .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-113.wav|she is no encumbrance here .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-011.wav|her displeasure , her penetration , and her happiness were all fearful to encounter ; and the dependence of having others present when they met was fanny's only support in looking forward to it . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-106.wav|and as the carpenter's work may be done at home by christopher jackson himself , it will be too absurd to talk of expense ; and as long as jackson is employed , everything will be right with sir thomas . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-008.wav|having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note would convey , she could not but be astonished to see mister crawford , as she accidentally did , coming up to the house again , and at an hour as early as the day before .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-141.wav|and a very pretty story it is , and with more truth in it , i dare say , than does credit to miss anderson . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-11-094.wav|it was a sort of renewed separation from mansfield ; and she could not think of his returning to town , and being frequently with mary and edmund , without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate herself for having them .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-118.wav|a short silence succeeded her leaving them ; but her brother soon returned to business and lovers ' vows , and was eagerly looking over the play , with mister yates 's help , to ascertain what scenery would be necessary , while maria and henry crawford conversed together in an under-voice , and the declaration with which she began of . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-01-41.wav|so we never saw dick any more . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-18-33.wav|he has come at a gallop nearly all the way , sir , and i was to give him a rest here ; but i think my master would not be against it , if you think fit , sir .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-45-22.wav|polly asked no questions , but opened the door and held the lantern for him . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-014.wav|when no longer under the same roof with edmund , she trusted that miss crawford would have no motive for writing , strong enough to overcome the trouble , and that at portsmouth their correspondence would dwindle into nothing .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-158.wav|they remained together at the otherwise deserted card table , talking very comfortably , and not thinking of the rest , till some of the rest began to think of them .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-033.wav|you have space to work upon there , and grounds that will well reward you . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-12-116.wav|the impossibility of not doing everything in the world to make fanny price happy , or of ceasing to love fanny price , was of course the groundwork of his eloquent answer . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-49-13.wav|they all came and looked at me and asked questions . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-096.wav|it would be taking liberties with my father's house in his absence , which could not be justified .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-161.wav|it is anger to be talked of rather than felt . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-108.wav|to want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible , so i told my maid to speak for one directly .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-08-41.wav|you are a good bit happier than when you came to us , i think .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-087.wav|fanny was confused , but it was the confusion of discontent . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-007.wav|we have got a play , said he .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-029.wav|it is fortunate that your inclination and your father 's convenience should accord so well . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-07-15.wav|we had very good fun in the free meadows , galloping up and down and chasing each other round and round the field ; then standing still under the shade of the trees . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-169.wav|if by any officious exertions of his , she is induced to leave henry 's protection , there will be much less chance of his marrying her , than if she remain with him .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-04-015.wav|for in spite of the acknowledged importance of her riding on horseback , no measures were taken for mounting her again , because , as it was observed by her aunts , she might ride one of her cousin's horses at any time when they did not want them , and as the miss bertrams regularly wanted their horses every fine day , and had no idea of carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice of any real pleasure , that time , of course , never came .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-153.wav|but this i will say , that his fault , the liking to make girls a little in love with him , is not half so dangerous to a wife's happiness , as a tendency to fall in love himself , which he has never been addicted to .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-017.wav|she felt it to be indeed very charming and was actually practising her steps about the drawing room , as long as she could be safe from the notice of her aunt norris , who was entirely taken up at first in fresh arranging and injuring the noble fire which the butler had prepared . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-114.wav|and it needed all the felicity of being again at home , and all the forbearance it could supply , to save sir thomas from anger on finding himself thus bewildered in his own house , making part of a ridiculous exhibition in the midst of theatrical nonsense , and forced in so untoward a moment to admit the acquaintance of a young man , whom he felt sure of disapproving , and whose easy indifference and volubility in the course of the first five minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of the two .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-061.wav|to fanny 's mind , edmund's absence was really in its cause and its tendency a relief .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-037.wav|she went , however , and they sauntered about together many an half-hour in missus grant 's shrubbery , the weather being unusually mild for the time of year , and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches , now comparatively unsheltered , remaining there perhaps till in the midst of some tender ejaculation of fanny's , on the sweets of so protracted an autumn .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-04-070.wav|he could not accommodate his sister in an article of such importance ; but he escorted her , with the utmost kindness , into northamptonshire , and as readily engaged to fetch her away again at half an hour's notice , whenever she were weary of the place .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-099.wav|she began to feel that she had not yet gone through all the changes of opinion and sentiment , which the progress of time and variation of circumstances occasion in this world of changes . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-07-09.wav|there was no kind master like yours to look after me , and talk to me , and bring me nice things to eat .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-11-017.wav|and everything looked so beautiful under the influence of such a sky , the effects of the shadows pursuing each other on the ships at spithead , and the island beyond , with the ever-varying hues of the sea , now at high water , dancing in its glee and dashing against the ramparts with so fine a sound , produced altogether such a combination of charms for fanny , as made her gradually almost careless of the circumstances , under which she felt them .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-45-39.wav|yes , said harry quickly , and the doctor said that father had a better chance than most men because he didn't drink . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-110.wav|i am glad you gave him something considerable , said lady bertram , with most unsuspicious calmness , for i gave him only ten pounds . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-12-003.wav|i have to inform you , my dearest fanny , that henry has been down to portsmouth to see you ; that he had a delightful walk with you to the dockyard last saturday , and one still more to be dwelt on the next day , on the ramparts ; when the balmy air , the sparkling sea and your sweet looks , and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony , and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy , even in retrospect .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-48-17.wav|he put out his hand and gave me a kind pat on the neck . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-035.wav|i was suddenly upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field , in the midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills ; a small stream before me to be forded , a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right , which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place , and not a gentleman or half a gentleman's house to be seen excepting one to be presumed the parsonage within a stone's throw of the said knoll and church . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-19-39.wav|and yet , said john , i am sure the young ladies did not mean it ; it was only ignorance . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-026.wav|i believe you are right , fanny , was his reply , after a short consideration . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-29-38.wav|some of the sights i saw there , where a horse had to come downhill , with a heavily loaded two-wheel cart behind him , on which no drag could be placed , make me sad even now to think of .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-08-015.wav|it was the abode of noise , disorder , and impropriety . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-023.wav|do not you think , said fanny , after a little consideration , that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon missus crawford , as her niece has been entirely brought up by her ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-08-108.wav|with the deepest blushes fanny protested against such a thought . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-20-22.wav|joe knocked at the door , and shouted , halloo ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-09-032.wav|she gave the history of her recent visit , and now her raptures might well be over ; for edmund was so struck with the circumstance , so delighted with what miss crawford had done , so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct between them , that fanny could not but admit the superior power of one pleasure over his own mind , though it might have its drawback . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-089.wav|not all her precautions , however , could save her from being suspected of something better ; or perhaps , her very display of the importance of a spare room might have misled sir thomas to suppose it really intended for fanny . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-045.wav|his manner seemed changed , his voice was quick from the agitation of joy ; and all that had been awful in his dignity seemed lost in tenderness . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-054.wav|i could not tell whether you would be for some meat , or only a dish of tea after your journey , or else i would have got something ready . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-048.wav|fanny , quite surprised , endeavored to show herself mistress of the room by her civilities , and looked at the bright bars of her empty grate with concern . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-073.wav|at length there was a pause . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-003.wav|as she opened and saw its length , she prepared herself for a minute detail of happiness , and a profusion of love and praise towards the fortunate creature , who was now mistress of his fate . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-35-21.wav|jerry patted me on the neck : no , jack , a shilling would not pay for that sort of thing , would it , old boy ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-18-14.wav|now , said john , do you keep the gate open for the doctor ; here 's the money , and off he went again . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-053.wav|but he was master at mansfield park . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-043.wav|i don't know what sir thomas may think of such matters ; he may be too much of the courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-039.wav|the whole subject of it was love . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-17-029.wav|miss crawford came with looks of gaiety , which seemed an insult , with friendly expressions towards herself , which she could hardly answer calmly . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-058.wav|i did , and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-16-62.wav|james said the roof and floor had fallen all in , and that only the black walls were standing ; the two poor horses that could not be got out were buried under the burned rafters and tiles . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-057.wav|the distinction was too great ; it was treating her like her cousins ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-049.wav|as she spoke , and it was with expression , she walked to the gate : he followed her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-08-006.wav|and at last , on a hint from miss bertram , mister rushworth discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to walk down to the parsonage directly , and call on mister crawford and inquire whether wednesday would suit him or not . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-029.wav|so the uniform remained at portsmouth , and edmund conjectured that before fanny had any chance of seeing it , all its own freshness and all the freshness of its wearer's feelings must be worn away .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-18-62.wav|i heard him say to himself over and over again , stupid boy ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-02-029.wav|i cured him at last ; but he was very bad all the winter and this was such a day , i could not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-16-069.wav|but if i can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business , of limiting the exhibition , of concentrating our folly , i shall be well repaid .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-01-060.wav|i never knew an instance of it . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-02-19.wav|they have lost the scent , said the old horse ; perhaps the hare will get off .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-16-091.wav|she was very kind , indeed , and i am glad to have her spared .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-189.wav|how abominable in you then , to let me engross her horse as i did all last week ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-183.wav|lady bertram made no objection ; and every one concerned in the going was forward in expressing their ready concurrence , excepting edmund , who heard it all , and said nothing .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-120.wav|without any display of doing more than the rest , or any fear of doing too much , he was always true to her interests , and considerate of her feelings , trying to make her good qualities understood , and to conquer the diffidence , which prevented their being more apparent ; giving her advice , consolation , and encouragement . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-09-074.wav|she had no doubt of what would ensue .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-099.wav|she did not know what to do or what to think . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-062.wav|the maids do their work very well , and i think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-049.wav|i shall love nothing there . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-117.wav|three grown up . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-138.wav|do not be so shamefaced . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-39-21.wav|after that i had a three-mile fare , and there were bags and boxes enough to have brought in a good many twopences , if they had been put outside ; but you know how people do ; all that could be piled up inside on the front seat were put in , and three heavy boxes went on the top . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-015.wav|but here she hoped too much ; miss crawford was not the slave of opportunity . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-112.wav|they have all , perhaps , been corrupting one another . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-112.wav|lady bertram was quite talkative . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-114.wav|you did look remarkably well ; everybody said so ; sir thomas said so , and you know you had chapman to help you dress . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-083.wav|but there is nobleness in the name of edmund . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-49-49.wav|i have now lived in this happy place a whole year . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-22-32.wav|of course they are not a match in color but my idea is that they will do very well for the carriage , while we are in the country . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-27-21.wav|the mare shall have a twelve-month's run , and we shall see what that will do for her ; but the black one must be sold ; tis a great pity , but i could not have knees like these in my stables . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-01-112.wav|there will be some difficulty in our way , missus norris , observed sir thomas , as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up : how to preserve in the minds of my daughters the consciousness of what they are , without making them think too lowly of their cousin ; and how , without depressing her spirits too far , to make her remember that she is not a miss bertram . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-097.wav|here's what may leave all painting and all music behind , and what poetry only can attempt to describe ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-24-38.wav|i gave a loud , shrill neigh for help ; again and again i neighed , pawing the ground impatiently , and tossing my head to get the rein loose . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-30-03.wav|my new master was an unmarried man . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-17-099.wav|he had not to wait and wish , with vacant affections for an object worthy to succeed her in them . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-112.wav|yes ; i do not know how it has happened . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-018.wav|it is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now , as we are so far from the house already , said mister crawford , when he was gone . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-32-30.wav|i'll give twenty-four for him . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-01-121.wav|she probably thought change of air might agree with many of her children . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-016.wav|he was not intending , however , by such action , to be conveying to her that unqualified approbation and encouragement , which her hopes drew from it . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-31-12.wav|i had a loose box , and might have been very comfortable , if he had not been too indolent to clean it out . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-08-058.wav|in a review of the two houses as they appeared to her before the end of a week , fanny was tempted to apply to them doctor johnson's celebrated judgment , as to matrimony and celibacy , and say that though mansfield park might have some pains , portsmouth could have no pleasures . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-062.wav|if the first calculation is wrong , we make a second better . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-033.wav|her mother , however , could not stay long enough to suspect anything . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-30-13.wav|he had been a hostler in one of the great hotels in bath . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-044.wav|he had never been so kind , so very kind to her in his life . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-003.wav|the business of finding a play that would suit everybody proved to be no trifle ; and the carpenter had received his orders and taken his measurements , had suggested and removed at least two sets of difficulties , and having made the necessity of an enlargement of plan , and expense fully evident , was already at work , while a play was still to seek . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-201.wav|anything might be bearable rather than such reproaches . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-09-034.wav|her correspondence with her aunt bertram was her only concern of higher interest . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-003.wav|how is the consternation of the party to be described ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-12-040.wav|this was fanny's most frequent expectation . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-016.wav|as to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such weather might occasion at home , she had nothing to suffer on that score ; for as her being out was known only to her two aunts , she was perfectly aware that none would be felt , and that in whatever cottage aunt norris might choose to establish her during the rain , her being in such cottage would be indubitable to aunt bertram . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-205.wav|miss crawford was too much vexed by what had passed to be in a humor for anything but music . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-48-51.wav|he always came with kind words and caresses , and of course i grew very fond of him . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-006.wav|had she been tall , full formed , and fair , it might have been more of a trial : but as it was , there could be no comparison ; and she was most allowably a sweet , pretty girl , while they were the finest young women in the country . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-078.wav|yes , sir . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-36-13.wav|year in and year out , not a day's rest , and never a sunday with my wife and children ; and never able to go to a place of worship , which i had always been used to do before i took to the driving box . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-11-052.wav|fanny thanked him again , but was affected and distressed to a degree , that made it impossible for her to say much , or even to be certain of what she ought to say . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-14-106.wav|fanny's disgust at the greater part of this letter , with her extreme reluctance to bring the writer of it and her cousin edmund together , would have made her as she felt incapable of judging impartially whether the concluding offer might be accepted or not . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-16-084.wav|but it is absolutely impossible to let tom go on in this way , riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act , no matter whom .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-08-034.wav|no , my dear edmund , that will not quite do . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-30-30.wav|no , very gently . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-032.wav|she must be courteous , and she must be compassionate . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-157.wav|it was impossible for many of the others not to smile . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-154.wav|was she as much plagued as herself to get tolerable servants ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-25-28.wav|but he answered angrily with an oath ; and almost before he was out of the town he began to gallop , frequently giving me a sharp cut with his whip , though i was going at full speed . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-024.wav|it was a beautiful sight . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-115.wav|i shall not ride tomorrow certainly , said fanny ; i have been out very often lately , and would rather stay at home . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-192.wav|missus norris , however , had gone home and taken down two old prayer books of her husband , with that idea ; but upon examination , the ardor of generosity went off . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-179.wav|she could not but feel some resentment against mister crawford . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-12-045.wav|what an unworthy attachment ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-24-87.wav|they asked him in to take a drop of something . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-210.wav|yes ; that is , it was the fault of my own mind , if i did not . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-33-43.wav|the first week of my life as a cab horse was very trying .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-172.wav|but her uncle's anger gave her the severest pain of all .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-17-064.wav|i do not think we do so well without him .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-09-127.wav|but fanny , stopping her by taking her hand and speaking low and seriously , you know what all this means . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-09-033.wav|and she would have been glad to have been sure of such a letter every week . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-41-38.wav|the horse would stop of his own accord at the doors where they took coal of him . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-073.wav|missus fraser has been my intimate friend for years . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-245.wav|missus norris , much discontented , was obliged to compose herself to work again ; and fanny , walking off in agitating consciousness , found herself as she anticipated , in another minute alone with mister crawford . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-132.wav|i am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head , but i was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-165.wav|and fanny , averting her face , said with a firmer tone than usual , as far as i am concerned , sir , i would not have delayed his return for a day . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-37-33.wav|jerry thanked him kindly , but said as he had some dinner with him , there was nothing he should like so well as walking about in the meadow . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-46-27.wav|quite down , give him his head altogether . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-010.wav|nothing remained of last night but remembrances , which she had nobody to share in . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-199.wav|i must go , and look through that iron gate at the same view , without being able to see it so well . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-04-106.wav|oh yes , i am not at all ashamed of it . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-146.wav|she could just find selfishness enough to wonder whether edmund had written to miss crawford before this summons came , but no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate and disinterestedly anxious . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-043.wav|thornton lacey was the name of his impending living , as miss crawford well knew ; and her interest in a negotiation for william price's knave increased . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-151.wav|do not hurry yourself , i entreat . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-193.wav|miss crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-009.wav|mister crawford suggested the greater desirableness of some carriage which might convey more than two . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-46-33.wav|jakes took the rein , come on , blackie . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-09-19.wav|they rode me by turns , and i galloped them about , up and down the fields and all about the orchard , for a good hour . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-111.wav|fanny , who had heard it all , and borne edmund company in every feeling throughout the whole , now ventured to say , in her anxiety to suggest some comfort , perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit them . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-08-041.wav|william had wanted to buy her a gold chain too , but the purchase had been beyond his means , and therefore not to wear the cross might be mortifying him . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-32-54.wav|let me get him a bran mash while you rub him down , said the mother . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-32-15.wav|of course i judged a good deal of the buyers by their manners to myself . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-18-60.wav|i could not tell him how i felt , but he seemed to know it all ; he covered me up with two or three warm cloths , and then ran to the house for some hot water ; he made me some warm gruel , which i drank , and then i think i went to sleep . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-126.wav|missus rushworth was quite ready to retire , and make way for the fortunate young woman , whom her dear son had selected ; and very early in november removed herself , her maid , her footman , and her chariot , with true dowager propriety , to bath , there to parade over the wonders of sotherton in her evening parties ; enjoying them as thoroughly , perhaps , in the animation of a card table , as she had ever done on the spot . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-36-34.wav|and it is easy work for the horses ; not like tearing along to catch trains for people that are always a quarter of an hour too late .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-103.wav|he then returned to his former station , and went on as if there had been no such tender interruption . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-02-077.wav|it was well at that moment that tom had to speak , and not his sister . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-004.wav|its object was unquestionable ; and two moments were enough to start the probability of its being merely to give her notice that they should be in portsmouth that very day , and to throw her into all the agitation of doubting what she ought to do in such a case . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-23-03.wav|one day my lady came down later than usual , and the silk rustled more than ever . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-051.wav|he had but one opinion . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-49-19.wav|it was then arranged that i should be sent for the next day . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-49-12.wav|in about ten minutes he returned , followed by three ladies ; one tall , pale lady , wrapped in a white shawl , leaned on a younger lady with dark eyes and a merry face ; the other , a very stately-looking person , was miss blomefield . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-140.wav|she could not but own that she should be very glad of a little tea , and susan immediately set about making it , as if pleased to have the employment all to herself ; and with only a little unnecessary bustle , and some few injudicious attempts at keeping her brothers in better order than she could , acquitted herself very well . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-02-042.wav|yes , indeed , and the more you know of him the better you will like him . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-15-46.wav|a fine horse killed , too , wasn't there ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-12-028.wav|missus grant , i believe , suspects him of a preference for julia ; i have never seen much symptom of it , but i wish it may be so . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-22-40.wav|presently we heard the rustling sound of silk as my lady came down the flight of stone steps . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-143.wav|her entreaty had no effect on tom : he only said again what he had said before . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-078.wav|by god , you are just in time ; the doctor has been here inquiring for you . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-09-13.wav|i thought you did know better than that ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-09-114.wav|i wished to engage miss crawford for the first two dances , was the explanation that followed , and brought fanny to life again , enabling her , as she found she was expected to speak , to utter something like an inquiry as to the result . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-06-070.wav|this was exactly what sir thomas and edmund had been separately conniving at , as each proved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity , with which they both advised missus norris's continuing where she was , instead of rushing out into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-02-111.wav|missus norris contrived to remove one article from his sight that might have distressed him .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-09-073.wav|to her , the handwriting itself , independent of anything it may convey , is a blessedness . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-061.wav|there have been two or three fine old trees cut down that grew too near the house , and it opens the prospect amazingly , which makes me think that repton , or anybody of that sort , would certainly have the avenue at sotherton down : the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill , you know , turning to miss bertram particularly as he spoke . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-193.wav|some very grave reproof or at least the coldest expression of indifference must be coming to distress her brother , and sink her to the ground .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-084.wav|and i am quite convinced that your being with missus norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health , and as much for your ultimate happiness too . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-012.wav|she absented herself as little as possible from lady bertram , kept away from the east room , and took no solitary walk in the shrubbery , in her caution to avoid any sudden attack . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-158.wav|oh , what a corrupted mind ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-065.wav|fanny was ready and waiting , and missus norris was beginning to scold her for not being gone , and still no horse was announced , no edmund appeared . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-04-080.wav|miss crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very near them , and not at all displeased either at her sister's early care , or the choice it had fallen on .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-132.wav|you can not doubt your being missed by many , said she . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-16-108.wav|he went ; but there was no reading , no china , no composure for fanny . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-25-39.wav|the moon had just risen above the hedge , and by its light i could see smith lying a few yards beyond me .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-14-23.wav|he would have eighteen shillings a week at first , a stable suit , a driving suit , a bedroom over the coachhouse , and a boy under him .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-42-03.wav|as we came into the yard one afternoon , polly came out . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-10-003.wav|there were three different conclusions to be drawn from his silence , between which her mind was in fluctuation ; each of them at times being held the most probable .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-059.wav|this is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-045.wav|the first feeling was disappointment : he had hoped better things ; he had thought that an hour's entreaty from a young man like crawford could not have worked so little change on a gentle-tempered girl like fanny .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-35-37.wav|perhaps you try to pass , but just then something else comes on , dashing in through the narrow opening , and you have to keep in behind the omnibus again . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-036.wav|but is not it very natural , observed edmund , that missus grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-48-15.wav|oh , yes , my boy , said the farmer coming closer , he might have been anything when he was young .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-087.wav|missus rushworth submitted ; and the question of surveying the grounds , with the who and the how , was likely to be more fully agitated . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-171.wav|i am sure i do not know how it was to have been done better , cried missus norris , unable to be longer deaf ; unless i had gone myself , indeed ; but i can not be in two places at once ; and i was talking to mister green at that very time about your mother's dairymaid , by her desire , and had promised john groom to write to missus jefferies about his son , and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-04-042.wav|mister rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty of miss bertram , and being inclined to marry soon fancied himself in love .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-17-124.wav|after settling her at thornton lacey with every kind attention to her comfort , the object of almost every day was to see her there , or to get her away from it .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-121.wav|i shall be most happy to play to you both , said miss crawford ; at least as long as you can like to listen , probably much longer , for i dearly love music myself , and where the natural taste is equal , the player must always be best off , for she is gratified in more ways than one . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-09-056.wav|susan showed that she had delicacy : pleased as she was to be mistress of property , which she had been struggling for at least two years , she yet feared that her sister's judgment had been against her , and that a reproof was designed for her having so struggled , as to make the purchase necessary for the tranquillity of the house . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-066.wav|oh , depend upon it , your aunt can do very well without you , or you would not be allowed to go .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-14-33.wav|in a few days after this conversation it was fully settled that james should go to clifford hall , in a month or six weeks , as it suited his master , and in the meantime he was to get all the practice in driving that could be given to him .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-29-100.wav|it seemed like old times again , and made me feel quite gay . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-174.wav|she looked at him , but he was leaning back , sunk in a deeper gloom than ever , and with eyes closed , as if the view of cheerfulness oppressed him , and the lovely scenes of home must be shut out . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-148.wav|oh , i am sure it is not in woman's nature to refuse such a triumph . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-35-27.wav|can you take me to the south-eastern railway , said the young man . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-229.wav|when the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past , she could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally concluded , and mister crawford once gone from mansfield , that everything would soon be as if no such subject had existed . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-02-065.wav|but they had seen no one from the parsonage , not a creature , and had heard no tidings beyond a friendly note of congratulation and inquiry from missus grant to lady bertram .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-16-55.wav|i did not hear much , for the hostler was rubbing me down , but i could see that james looked very happy , and i thought the master was proud of him .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-025.wav|but i must now , my dear maria , tell you , that i think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that i hope you will give it up .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-37-23.wav|away she went , and soon returned , saying that he could have the trap and welcome . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-054.wav|she was a little surprised that he could spend so many hours with miss crawford , and not see more of the sort of fault , which he had already observed , and of which she was almost always reminded by a something of the same nature , whenever she was in her company ; but , so it was .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-086.wav|after continuing in chat with the party round the fire a few minutes , miss crawford returned to the party round the table ; and standing by them , seemed to interest herself in their arrangements till , as if struck by a sudden recollection she exclaimed , my good friends , you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses , inside and out ; but pray let me know my fate in the meanwhile .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-050.wav|he was after her immediately . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-24-47.wav|scarcely drawing the rein , blantyre shouted , which way ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-141.wav|advise was his word , but it was the advice of absolute power and she had only to rise and , with mister crawford 's very cordial adieus , pass quietly away ; stopping at the entrance door , like the lady of branxholm hall , one moment and no more to view the happy scene , and take a last look at the five or six determined couple , who were still hard at work .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-09-159.wav|he had said enough to give fanny some happier feelings than she had lately known and with a brighter look she answered , yes , cousin , i am convinced that you would be incapable of anything else , though perhaps some might not . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-16-038.wav|i do not know what to do ; this acting scheme gets worse and worse , you see . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-138.wav|fanny would rather have had edmund tell the story , but his determined silence obliged her to relate her brother's situation . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-085.wav|when sir thomas understood this , he felt the necessity of making his own wife and sister-in-law acquainted with the business without delay ; though on fanny 's account , he almost dreaded the effect of the communication to missus norris , as much as fanny herself . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-011.wav|lovers' vows , in a tone of the greatest amazement , was his only reply to mister rushworth , and he turned towards his brother and sisters , as if hardly doubting a contradiction .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-10-006.wav|it was a gentleman's voice ; it was a voice that fanny was just turning pale about , when mister crawford walked into the room . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-040.wav|a marriage of love was to be described by the gentleman , and very little short of a declaration of love to be made by the lady .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-162.wav|fanny was silent ; but not from being convinced that there might not be a remedy found for some of these evils . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-33-34.wav|too smart-looking , said another , shaking his head in a wise way ; you'll find out something wrong one of these fine mornings , or my name isn't jones .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-099.wav|this could not be denied , and fanny was silenced . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-095.wav|it is so dark you do not see her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-34-13.wav|we soon found that the country we had come to was very different from our own , and that we had many hardships to endure besides the fighting ; but many of the men were so fond of their horses , that they did everything they could to make them comfortable , in spite of snow , wet , and all things out of order .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-08-046.wav|her continual disagreements with her mother , her rash squabbles with tom and charles and petulance with betsey were at least so distressing to fanny , that though admitting they were by no means without provocation , she feared the disposition that could push them to such length must be far from amiable , and from affording any repose to herself . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-026.wav|her diffidence , gratitude , and softness made every expression of indifference seem almost an effort of self-denial ; seem , at least , to be giving nearly as much pain to herself as to him .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-15-20.wav|that would be a pity ; and as to being quick , why , bless you !

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-07-20.wav|i was high bred and had a great deal of spirit , and was very wild , no doubt , and gave them , i dare say , plenty of trouble , but then it was dreadful to be shut up in a stall day after day instead of having my liberty , and i fretted and pined and wanted to get loose .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-17-009.wav|a stranger among them would have been the destruction of all their comfort ; and when edmund , pursuing that idea , gave a hint of his hope , as to the limitation of the audience , they were ready , in the complaisance of the moment , to promise anything .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-156.wav|by a look at her brother she prevented any farther entreaty from the theatrical board , and the really good feelings by which she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to all the little she had lost in edmund's favor .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-10-044.wav|he took care , however , that they should be allowed to go to the shops they came out expressly to visit ; and it did not delay them long , for fanny could so little bear to excite impatience , or be waited for , that before the gentlemen , as they stood at the door , could do more than begin upon the last naval regulations , or settle the number of three-deckers now in commission , their companions were ready to proceed .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-13-17.wav|i should think , sir , said john , he had better be without a rider , unless he can be ridden properly . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-074.wav|she must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you , said fanny with half a sigh , to have any such apprehension .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-072.wav|she carried this point , and sir thomas 's narrative proceeded .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-159.wav|henry crawford 's chair was the first to be given a direction towards them , and he sat silently observing them for a few minutes ; himself , in the meanwhile , observed by sir thomas , who was standing in chat with doctor grant .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-27-12.wav|with her high spirit , she strained herself to the utmost ; she came in with the first three horses , but her wind was touched , besides which he was too heavy for her , and her back was strained .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-076.wav|after a little while , i dare say , we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way , allowing for the difference of the time of year .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-19-04.wav|mister bond , the horse-doctor , came every day . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-44-51.wav|likely enough ; i'll come see him , said jerry . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-20-17.wav|mind your own business , you impudent young rascal , and i'll mind mine ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-162.wav|each was thoughtful . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-010.wav|she sat some time in a good deal of agitation , listening , trembling , and fearing to be sent for every moment ; but as no footsteps approached the east room , she grew gradually composed , could sit down and be able to employ herself , and able to hope that mister crawford had come , and would go without her being obliged to know anything of the matter . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-126.wav|she had hoped that , to a man like her uncle , so discerning , so honorable , so good , the simple acknowledgment of settled dislike on her side would have been sufficient . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-19-23.wav|john's voice almost startled me as he answered : only ignorance ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-01-008.wav|she had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation ; and such of their acquaintance as thought miss ward and miss frances quite as handsome as miss maria , did not scruple to predict their marrying with almost equal advantage . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-096.wav|oh , she has been trying for him , to such a degree . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-025.wav|yes , i dare say you will ; that's natural enough . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-065.wav|i wish he had known you as well as i do , fanny . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-102.wav|i do not think him at all handsome . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-013.wav|the whole party rose accordingly , and under missus rushworth's guidance were shown through a number of rooms , all lofty , and many large , and amply furnished in the taste of fifty years back , with shining floors , solid mahogany , rich damask , marble , gilding , and carving , each handsome in its way . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-106.wav|my cousin is grown up . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-030.wav|the pause which followed this fruitless effort was ended by the same speaker , who taking up one of the many volumes of plays that lay on the table , and turning it over , suddenly exclaimed , lovers ' vows ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-055.wav|i know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion , or accomplishment or good quality in the person , who have found themselves entirely deceived , and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-043.wav|she was quite oppressed . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-25-47.wav|i stood watching and listening . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-26-57.wav|and then , as she had no home or relations , she , with her six little children , was obliged once more to leave the pleasant home by the tall oak trees , and go into that great gloomy union house .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-03-31.wav|i hated the crupper ; to have my long tail doubled up and poked through that strap was almost as bad as the bit .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-013.wav|fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the play as any of them ; henry crawford acted well , and it was a pleasure to her to creep into the theater and attend the rehearsal of the first act , in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for maria . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-143.wav|in thus sending her away , sir thomas perhaps might not be thinking merely of her health . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-03-40.wav|i thought it very dreadful , but the cows went on eating very quietly , and hardly raised their heads as the great black frightful thing came puffing and grinding past . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-35-68.wav|well , said larry , you'll never be a rich man . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-053.wav|then she was shrinking again into herself , and blushing and working as hard as ever ; but it had been enough to give edmund encouragement for his friend , and as he cordially thanked him , he hoped to be expressing fanny's secret feelings too . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-01-078.wav|except to the attack on nanny 's cousin , sir thomas no longer made any objection , and a more respectable , though less economical rendezvous being accordingly substituted , everything was considered as settled , and the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-008.wav|it was a gloomy prospect , and all that she could do was to throw a mist over it and hope when the mist cleared away , she should see something else . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-022.wav|i do not censure her opinions ; but there certainly is impropriety in making them public .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-023.wav|no wonder that mister rushworth should think so at present , said missus grant to missus norris , with a smile ; but depend upon it , sotherton will have every improvement in time which his heart can desire . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-119.wav|edmund's friendship never failed her : his leaving eton for oxford made no change in his kind dispositions , and only afforded more frequent opportunities of proving them .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-033.wav|and on another account , too , i can perfectly comprehend . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-094.wav|and really , added edmund , the day is so mild that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-44-22.wav|i've seen what horses come to at that work round london . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-29-03.wav|then there is the steam engine style of driving ; these drivers were mostly people from towns , who never had a horse of their own and generally traveled by rail .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-128.wav|sir thomas came towards the table where she sat in trembling wretchedness , and with a good deal of cold sternness said , it is of no use , i perceive , to talk to you . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-01-095.wav|then she had better come to us , said lady bertram , with the utmost composure . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-129.wav|for maria could scarcely raise her eyes from her book , and lady bertram was half-asleep ; and even missus norris , discomposed by her niece 's ill-humour , and having asked one or two questions about the dinner , which were not immediately attended to , seemed almost determined to say no more . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-13-03.wav|one day when john and i had been out on some business of our master's , and were returning gently on a long , straight road , at some distance we saw a boy trying to leap a pony over a gate ; the pony would not take the leap , and the boy cut him with the whip , but he only turned off on one side .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-29-93.wav|i do n't like it , said the gentleman ; be so good as to take it off , and put the rein in at the cheek . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-17-037.wav|henry crawford had trifled with her feelings ; but she had very long allowed and even sought his attentions , with a jealousy of her sister so reasonable , as ought to have been their cure ; and now that the conviction of his preference for maria had been forced on her , she submitted to it without any alarm for maria 's situation , or any endeavor at rational tranquillity for herself . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-18-36.wav|the doctor came out with his riding-whip . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-149.wav|the conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright , for she found that mister crawford , under pretence of receiving the note , was coming towards her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-10-59.wav|i admit they do sometimes come too close to be pleasant , but we do n't run away ; we are used to it , and understand it , and if we never had blinkers put on we should never want them ; we should see what was there , and know what was what , and be much less frightened than by only seeing bits of things that we can't understand .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-222.wav|said missus norris , with a moment's check , that was very kind of you , sir thomas ; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-10-069.wav|he perceived that enough had been said of everingham , and that it would be as well to talk of something else and turned to mansfield .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-09-138.wav|for sometimes , fanny , i own to you , it does appear more than manner : it appears as if the mind itself was tainted .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-072.wav|we may be trusted , i think , in choosing some play most perfectly unexceptionable ; and i can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us , in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author , than in chattering in words of our own .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-021.wav|to be listened to and borne with , and hear the voice of kindness and sympathy in return , was everything that could be done for her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-025.wav|sir thomas , meanwhile , went on with his own hopes and his own observations , still feeling a right , by all his knowledge of human nature , to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and consequence on his niece's spirits , and the past attentions of the lover producing a craving for their return . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-13-32.wav|i well remember one day , just before afternoon school , i found him at the large window catching flies and pulling off their wings . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-084.wav|she was very civilly answered by lady bertram , but edmund said nothing . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-17-017.wav|there was comfort also in tom , who gradually regained his health , without regaining the thoughtlessness and selfishness of his previous habits . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-006.wav|he was in love , very much in love ; and it was a love which , operating on an active , sanguine spirit , of more warmth than delicacy , made her affection appear of greater consequence , because it was withheld , and determined him to have the glory as well as the felicity , of forcing her to love him . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-021.wav|she told him that she did not love him , could not love him , was sure she never should love him ; that such a change was quite impossible ; that the subject was most painful to her ; that she must entreat him never to mention it again , to allow her to leave him at once , and let it be considered as concluded for ever . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-06-071.wav|william and fanny soon showed themselves ; and sir thomas had the pleasure of receiving in his protege , certainly a very different person from the one he had equipped seven years ago , but a young man of an open , pleasant countenance , and frank , unstudied , but feeling and respectful manners , and such as confirmed him his friend . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-16-03.wav|later on in the evening a traveler's horse was brought in by the second hostler , and while he was cleaning him a young man with a pipe in his mouth lounged into the stable to gossip . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-039.wav|having formed her mind and gained her affections , he had a good chance of her thinking like him ; though at this period , and on this subject , there began now to be some danger of dissimilarity , for he was in a line of admiration of miss crawford , which might lead him where fanny could not follow .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-015.wav|she could only perceive that it must relate to wimpole street and mister crawford , and only conjecture that something very imprudent had just occurred in that quarter to draw the notice of the world , and to excite her jealousy , in miss crawford 's apprehension , if she heard it .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-055.wav|edmund was fond of speaking to her of miss crawford , but he seemed to think it enough that the admiral had since been spared ; and she scrupled to point out her own remarks to him , lest it should appear like ill-nature .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-166.wav|they were in the environs of mansfield long before the usual dinner time , and as they approached the beloved place , the hearts of both sisters sank a little .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-017.wav|i was three weeks in london , and saw her , for london , very often .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-040.wav|it is the same sort of thing , said fanny after a short pause , as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy , or the son of a general to be in the army , and nobody sees anything wrong in that . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-167.wav|three or four prices might have been swept away , any or all , except fanny and william , and lady bertram would have thought little about it ; or perhaps might have caught from missus norris 's lips the cant of its being a very happy thing , and a great blessing to their poor dear sister price , to have them so well provided for . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-08-093.wav|miss crawford had anticipated her wants with a kindness , which proved her a real friend .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-196.wav|i have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance , mister price , said henry crawford , leaning forward , and will engage to answer every inquiry , which you can make on the subject , to your entire satisfaction .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-11-13.wav|the pony plunged forward , but the strong , heavy hand held the pretty creature back with force almost enough to break its jaw , while the whip still cut into him .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-094.wav|i am very sorry , said she ; it is very unlucky . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-042.wav|had she ever given way to bursts of delight , it must have been then , for she was delighted , but her happiness was of a quiet , deep , heart-swelling sort ; and though never a great talker , she was always more inclined to silence , when feeling most strongly .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-147.wav|her aunt did not neglect her : she wrote again and again ; they were receiving frequent accounts from edmund , and these accounts were as regularly transmitted to fanny , in the same diffuse style , and the same medley of trusts , hopes , and fears , all following and producing each other at haphazard .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-119.wav|it appears a neat job , however , as far as i could judge by candlelight , and does my friend christopher jackson credit .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-037.wav|her father read his newspaper , and her mother lamented over the ragged carpet as usual , while the tea was in preparation , and wished rebecca would mend it ; and fanny was first roused by his calling out to her , after humphing and considering over a particular paragraph : what's the name of your great cousins in town , fan ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-128.wav|yes , half-past nine , said crawford to william , as the latter was leaving them , and i shall be punctual , for there will be no kind sister to get up for me .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-015.wav|as far as she could judge , mister crawford was considerably the best actor of all : he had more confidence than edmund , more judgment than tom , more talent and taste than mister yates .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-12-022.wav|i am rather surprised , said she , that mister crawford should come back again so soon after being here so long before , full seven weeks ; for i had understood , he was so very fond of change and moving about , that i thought something would certainly occur when he was once gone , to take him elsewhere .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-175.wav|and would he only have smiled upon her and called her my dear fanny , while he said it , every former frown or cold address might have been forgotten .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-004.wav|some members of their society sent away , and the spirits of many others saddened ; it was all sameness and gloom compared with the past ; a sombre family party rarely enlivened . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-137.wav|by their own accounts , they had been all walking after each other , and the junction which had taken place at last seemed to fanny's observation to have been as much too late for re-establishing harmony , as it confessedly had been for determining on any alteration .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-044.wav|miss bertram , feeling all the interest of an agatha in the question , took on her to decide it , by observing to mister yates that this was a point in which height , and figure ought to be considered , and that his being the tallest , seemed to fit him peculiarly for the baron .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-018.wav|he was , in fact , entirely on his father 's side of the question . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-002.wav|the honourable john yates , this new friend , had not much to recommend him beyond habits of fashion and expense , and being the younger son of a lord with a tolerable independence ; and sir thomas would probably have thought his introduction at mansfield by no means desirable .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-01-067.wav|i thoroughly understand you , cried missus norris , you are everything that is generous and considerate , and i am sure we shall never disagree on this point . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-077.wav|and when she saw sir thomas actually give william notes for the purpose , she was struck with the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage , and suddenly seized with a strong inclination to go with them , to go and see her poor dear sister price . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-088.wav|when , being earnestly invited by the miss bertrams to join in a glee , she tripped off to the instrument , leaving edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many virtues , from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-16-20.wav|the fresh air that had come in through the open door made it easier to breathe , but the rushing sound overhead grew louder , and as i looked upward through the bars of my empty rack i saw a red light flickering on the wall .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-097.wav|such were the counsels by which missus norris assisted to form her nieces' minds ; and it is not very wonderful that with all their promising talents and early information , they should be entirely deficient in the less common acquirements of self-knowledge , generosity , and humility .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-23-45.wav|before that , i never knew what it was to foam at the mouth , but now the action of the sharp bit on my tongue and jaw , and the constrained position of my head and throat , always caused me to froth at the mouth more or less .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-082.wav|we have had such incessant rains almost since october began , that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-077.wav|and he looked at fanny with an expressive smile , which evidently meant , that lady will never allow a theater at everingham . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-068.wav|the little rusticities and awkwardnesses , which had at first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all , and not least of herself , necessarily wore away , and she was no longer materially afraid to appear before her uncle , nor did her aunt norris's voice make her start very much .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-173.wav|and as miss bertram caught at the idea likewise , and gave it her full support , declaring that in her opinion , it was infinitely better to consult with friends , and disinterested advisers , than immediately to throw the business into the hands of a professional man , mister rushworth was very ready to request the favor of mister crawford's assistance . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-005.wav|yes , said lady bertram , she looks very well . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-151.wav|it is above a week since i saw miss crawford . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-100.wav|maria had a moment's struggle as she listened , and only a moment's : when her father ceased , she was able to give her answer immediately , decidedly , and with no apparent agitation .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-123.wav|it did pain her to have mansfield forgotten ; the friends who had done so much the dear , dear friends ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-032.wav|her happiness on this occasion was very much a la mortal , finely chequered .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-11-022.wav|she had a few tender reveries now and then , which he could sometimes take advantage of to look in her face without detection ; and the result of these looks was , that though as bewitching as ever her face was less blooming than it ought to be .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-41-18.wav|during this speech , the boy had stood by , sullen and dogged , but when his father ceased , he broke out angrily . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-180.wav|yet if he really loved her , and were unhappy too ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-043.wav|such language was so new to fanny that it quite embarrassed her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-089.wav|oh , that i could transport you for a short time , into our circle in town that you might understand how your power over henry is thought of there ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-044.wav|very fine indeed , said miss crawford , laughing . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-010.wav|i will speak to her , sir : i will take the first opportunity of speaking to her alone , was the result of such thoughts as these ; and upon sir thomas 's information of her being at that very time walking alone in the shrubbery , he instantly joined her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-06-022.wav|she is just what she was in october , believe me . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-08-020.wav|she had never been able to recall anything approaching to tenderness , in his former treatment of herself . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-09-005.wav|i came to look for you , and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in , was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-016.wav|he is thinking of november . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-03-08.wav|he seemed to like me , and said , when he has been well broken in he will do very well .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-33-14.wav|harry had been helping his father since the early morning , and had stated his opinion that i should turn out a regular brick . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-02-088.wav|to her he soon turned , repeating much of what he had already said with only a softened air and stronger expressions of regret . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-08-071.wav|miss crawford , pleased with the appeal , gave her all her best judgment and taste , made everything easy by her suggestions , and tried to make everything agreeable by her encouragement . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-080.wav|that was a fact beyond a doubt , and without an alloy . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-16-049.wav|it is not at all what i like , he continued . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-16-012.wav|the east room , as it had been called ever since maria bertram was sixteen , was now considered fanny's , almost as decidedly as the white attic : the smallness of the one making the use of the other so evidently reasonable , that the miss bertrams , with every superiority in their own apartments , which their own sense of superiority could demand , were entirely approving it . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-176.wav|but he had ended his speech , in a way to sink her in sad mortification by adding , if william does come to mansfield , i hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , i fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-098.wav|mister crawford was the first to move forward , to examine the capabilities of that end of the house . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-07-16.wav|but when it came to breaking in , that was a bad time for me . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-118.wav|oh , we do not want to disturb you from your seat . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-49-33.wav|i could not say that i remembered him , for now he was a fine grown young fellow with black whiskers and a man 's voice , but i was sure he knew me , and that he was joe green , and i was very glad . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-19-24.wav|only ignorance ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-083.wav|do you know we asked her last night which way she would go to get to ireland ; and she said , she should cross to the isle of wight . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-082.wav|and fanny was listening again with great entertainment . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-35-53.wav|at any rate , we whirled into the station with many more , just as the great clock pointed to eight minutes to twelve o'clock . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-37-04.wav|it has all come right , jerry ; missus briggs sent her servant this afternoon , to ask you to take her out tomorrow at eleven o'clock . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-123.wav|the rest might wait . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-123.wav|under the disadvantages , indeed , which both have had , is it not wonderful that they should be what they are ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-08-032.wav|her days were spent in a kind of slow bustle ; always busy without getting on , always behindhand and lamenting it , without altering her ways ; wishing to be an economist , without contrivance or regularity ; dissatisfied with her servants , without skill to make them better , and whether helping or reprimanding or indulging them without any power of engaging their respect . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-16-025.wav|but she had more than fears of her own perseverance to remove : she had begun to feel undecided as to what she ought to do ; and as she walked round the room her doubts were increasing . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-153.wav|you will see her , however , before she goes . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-109.wav|never had fanny more wanted a cordial . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-14-063.wav|this is my modest request and expectation , for you are so good , that i depend upon being treated better than i deserve , and i write now to beg an immediate answer . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-11-42.wav|i believe you are right in theory , said the other , and that's rather a hard bit about the soldiers ; but , well , i'll think about it , and so they parted . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-18-56.wav|how i wished for my warm , thick cloth , as i stood and trembled . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-083.wav|it must make him think ; and i have no doubt that he oftener endeavors to restrain himself , than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-16-060.wav|i heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger ; and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations , perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be , it would be ungenerous . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-38-18.wav|she was a general favorite on the stand , and there was not a man who would not have seen her safely across the street , if jerry had not been able to do it . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-04-086.wav|henry bowed and thanked her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-170.wav|such half-and-half doings never prosper . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-30-19.wav|so it went on for about two months ; and i wondered that my master did not see that something was the matter . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-04-26.wav|well , then , he said , i hope you are good-tempered ; i do not like any one next door who bites . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-110.wav|before the play , i am much mistaken , if julia did not think he was paying her attentions . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-12-031.wav|the value of a man like henry on such an occasion , is what you can have no conception of ; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-116.wav|i should think my aunt norris would be on your side . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-45-64.wav|all right , governor , said harry , i shall not leave him till he is ; you know i have been trained by my father . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-053.wav|after a short pause , however , the subject still continued , and was discussed with unabated eagerness , every one 's inclination increasing by the discussion , and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-129.wav|thank god , said he . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-051.wav|but this was immediately opposed by tom bertram , who asserted the part of amelia to be in every respect the property of miss crawford , if she would accept it . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-105.wav|so voluntarily , so freely , so coolly to canvass it ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-04-066.wav|for missus grant , having by this time run through the usual resources of ladies residing in the country without a family of children , having more than filled her favorite sitting room with pretty furniture , and made a choice collection of plants and poultry , was very much in want of some variety at home . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-023.wav|i was kept there from day to day in the hope of it , for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from mansfield . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-17-098.wav|edmund had greatly the advantage of her in this respect . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-02-038.wav|my object was accomplished in the visit . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-126.wav|can we be wrong if mary crawford feels the same ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-137.wav|i may be discovered by those who want to see me . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-090.wav|mister crawford was not only in the room , he was soon close to her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-064.wav|what is there to surprise you in it ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-121.wav|henry crawford was in the first glow of another scheme about thornton lacey ; and not being able to catch edmund's ear , was detailing it to his fair neighbor with a look of considerable earnestness . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-064.wav|she was slighted , maria was preferred ; the smile of triumph which maria was trying to suppress showed how well it was understood ; and before julia could command herself enough to speak , her brother gave his weight against her too by saying , oh yes , maria must be agatha ; maria will be the best agatha . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-171.wav|that she should see him go without a tear ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-12-126.wav|and they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be , and i wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-04-38.wav|one day she bit james in the arm and made it bleed , and so miss flora and miss jessie , who are very fond of me , were afraid to come into the stable . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-43-50.wav|a droll smile came over jerry's face as he shut the door upon them . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-113.wav|henry crawford looked rather foolish , and as if he did not know what to say . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-36-65.wav|several of the men applauded this , till jerry said : that may sound well enough , but it won't do . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-16-093.wav|her conscience stopt her in the middle , but edmund was satisfied . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-11-011.wav|missus price took her weekly walk on the ramparts every fine sunday throughout the year , always going directly after morning service and staying till dinner time . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-011.wav|edmund was almost as welcome to his brother as fanny to her aunt ; but missus norris , instead of having comfort from either , was but the more irritated by the sight of the person , whom in the blindness of her anger , she could have charged as the daemon of the piece . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-177.wav|i begin to think i shall never be a lieutenant , fanny . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-178.wav|here we are many that would be interested in your improvements , my dear mister rushworth , and that would like to hear mister crawford 's opinion on the spot , and that might be of some small use to you with their opinions . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-094.wav|james , said missus rushworth to her son , i believe the wilderness will be new to all the party . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-083.wav|and she immediately scrambled across the fence , and walked away , not attending to fanny's last question of whether she had seen anything of miss crawford and edmund . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-122.wav|it is not possible , but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject , some surmises as to what might be .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-091.wav|you think with me , i hope , turning with a softened voice to fanny . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-43-03.wav|at last came the election day ; there was no lack of work for jerry and me . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-149.wav|perhaps it is best for me , since it leaves me so little to regret .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-40-30.wav|a short time after this a cart with a dead horse in it passed our cab stand . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-143.wav|fanny 's feelings on the occasion were indeed considerably more warm and genuine than her aunt's style of writing . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-168.wav|while considering her with these ideas , betsey , at a small distance , was holding out something to catch her eyes , meaning to screen it at the same time from susan's .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-139.wav|but then i considered it as meaning nothing : i put it down as simply being his way , and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-081.wav|oh , what is the matter , asked her ladyship , in the heavy tone of one half-roused ; i was not asleep . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-015.wav|on the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly to miss crawford and fanny , but there was no comparison in the willingness of their attention , for miss crawford , who had seen scores of great houses , and cared for none of them , had only the appearance of civilly listening .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-08-114.wav|there is the parsonage : a tidy-looking house , and i understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-214.wav|her uncle's behavior to her was then as nearly as possible what it had been before . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-012.wav|a trifling part , said he , and not at all to my taste , and such a one as i certainly would not accept again ; but i was determined to make no difficulties . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-114.wav|you would have heard of balls and parties . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-086.wav|he deprecated her mistaken but well-meaning zeal . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-10-051.wav|crawford could not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down ; but he could have wished her sister away . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-02-092.wav|the hand , which had so pressed hers to his heart ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-057.wav|my uncle , repeated fanny , with a frightened look . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-004.wav|to the greater number it was a moment of absolute horror . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-041.wav|if it had not been for that , we should have carried on the garden wall , and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard , just as doctor grant has done . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-01-068.wav|whatever i can do , as you well know , i am always ready enough to do for the good of those i love ; and though i could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard i bear your own dear children , nor consider her , in any respect , so much my own , i should hate myself if i were capable of neglecting her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-029.wav|the expense need not be any impediment . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-005.wav|he had vanity , which strongly inclined him in the first place , to think she did love him , though she might not know it herself ; and which , secondly , when constrained at last to admit that she did know her own present feelings , convinced him that he should be able in time to make those feelings what he wished . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-01-04.wav|part one . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-124.wav|was not he devoted to you at the ball ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-06-100.wav|young as he was , william had already seen a great deal . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-27-28.wav|they'll soon take you away , said ginger , and i shall lose the only friend i have , and most likely we shall never see each other again . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-164.wav|he seemed determined to be answered . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-17-25.wav|i was a farmer's boy , not earning enough to keep myself , much less both of us , and she must have gone to the workhouse but for our mistress nelly calls her her angel , and she has good right to do so . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-088.wav|and i am sure , my name was norval , every evening of my life through one christmas holidays . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-073.wav|the future must be very uncertain , and now , my dear fanny , this subject is closed between us . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-026.wav|she is a cold-hearted , vain woman , who has married entirely from convenience , and though evidently unhappy in her marriage , places her disappointment , not to faults of judgment or temper , or disproportion of age , but to her being , after all , less affluent than many of her acquaintance , especially than her sister , lady stornaway , and is the determined supporter of everything mercenary , and ambitious , provided it be only mercenary and ambitious enough . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-47-15.wav|i went on the stand at eight in the morning , and had done a good share of work , when we had to take a fare to the railway .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-171.wav|their spirits were in general exhausted ; and to determine whether the day had afforded most pleasure or pain , might occupy the meditations of almost all . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-050.wav|i began to think you would never come . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-27-32.wav|through the recommendation of york , i was bought by the master of the livery stables . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-021.wav|were questions immediately following with the readiest good humor . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-043.wav|my aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-187.wav|suffice it , that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike and generous manner , and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his understanding , heart , and temper . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-09-007.wav|you ought to have had it a week ago , but there has been a delay from my brother's not being in town by several days so soon as i expected ; and i have only just now received it at northampton . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-30-11.wav|i found that my groom understood his business .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-17-003.wav|such a victory over edmund 's discretion had been beyond their hopes , and was most delightful . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-27-22.wav|no , my lord , of course not , said york ; but he might get a place where appearance is not of much consequence , and still be well treated . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-39-26.wav|you can't help yourself , you must put your wife and children before the horse . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-34-31.wav|i can not tell all that happened on that day , but i will tell of the last charge that we made together ; it was across a valley right in front of the enemy's cannon . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-096.wav|where did you leave miss crawford , fanny ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-045.wav|you will be what you ought to be to her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-068.wav|he smiled as he answered , i am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance , fanny . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-18-28.wav|wait , he said , i will come . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-123.wav|i shall always have a bed for a friend . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-083.wav|there is something in this which my comprehension does not reach . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-115.wav|well , then , fanny , you shall not get up tomorrow before i go . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-28-47.wav|when he was gone my driver began to flop the reins about and whip the harness , by which i understood that i was to go on , which of course i did , glad that the stone was gone , but still in a good deal of pain . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-076.wav|your ladyship is quite mistaken ; no theater at everingham ; no , no ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-064.wav|she had probably alienated love by the helplessness , and fretfulness of a fearful temper , or been unreasonable in wanting a larger share than any one among so many could deserve . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-098.wav|more can not be hoped . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-141.wav|not , i should hope , of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-043.wav|sir thomas was obliged , or obliged himself to wait , till the morrow for a knowledge of what had passed between the young people . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-062.wav|you must rehearse it with me , that i may fancy you , him , and get on by degrees . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-135.wav|it would be absolutely impossible for me . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-034.wav|missus rushworth had left her husband's house : mister rushworth had been in great anger and distress to him , mister harding for his advice ; mister harding feared there had been at least very flagrant indiscretion .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-104.wav|nothing of that kind could be hired in the village . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-04-04.wav|it was early in may , when there came a man from squire gordon 's , who took me away to the hall . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-127.wav|as mister rushworth did not come , the injury was increased , and she had not even the relief of showing her power over him ; she could only be sullen to her mother , aunt , and cousin , and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-34-19.wav|my master 's cheery voice , as he encouraged his men , made me feel as if he and i could not be killed . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-060.wav|i only wish tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began , for there was the loss of half a day's work about those side doors . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-17-012.wav|perhaps , said tom , fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now ; perhaps you may persuade her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-019.wav|she did it with wretched feelings , but it was inevitable . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-090.wav|there goes a temper which would never give pain ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-111.wav|edmund said no more . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-135.wav|this threat was so palpably disregarded , that though within five minutes afterwards , the three boys all burst into the room together and sat down , fanny could not consider it as a proof of anything more than their being for the time thoroughly fagged , which their hot faces and panting breaths seemed to prove , especially as they were still kicking each other's shins , and hallooing out at sudden starts immediately under their father's eye . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-02-17.wav|after them came a number of men on horseback , some of them in green coats , all galloping as fast as they could . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-08-110.wav|its being a gift of my brother's need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it , as i assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with it . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-088.wav|does his staying longer surprise you ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-07-14.wav|we did not care for them , but of course it made us more wild , and we settled it in our minds that boys were our enemies . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-029.wav|i understand , cried her uncle , recollecting himself , and not wanting to hear more . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-085.wav|i am sure i should have been ashamed of myself , if i had not known better long before i was so old as she is . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-129.wav|and in a lower tone to fanny , i shall have only a desolate house to hurry from . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-105.wav|mister edmund bertram , as you do not act yourself , you will be a disinterested adviser ; and therefore , i apply to you . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-071.wav|yes , she does look very well , was lady bertram's placid reply . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-061.wav|it had left her nothing to do . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-160.wav|without any particular affection for her eldest cousin , her tenderness of heart made her feel that she could not spare him , and the purity of her principles added yet a keener solicitude , when she considered how little useful , how little self-denying his life had apparently been . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-19-18.wav|i know he meant no harm , i never said he did ; i know he is not a bad boy . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-062.wav|but miss bertram thought it most becoming to reply , the avenue , oh , i do not recollect it . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-193.wav|and when i hear of you next , it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of methodists , or as a missionary into foreign parts . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-04-064.wav|the admiral delighted in the boy , missus crawford doted on the girl ; and it was the lady's death which now obliged her protegee , after some months' further trial at her uncle's house , to find another home . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-08-080.wav|to whose happy lot was it to fall ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-189.wav|he was ashamed to think that for four days together she had not had the power of riding , and very seriously resolved , however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of miss crawford's , that it should never happen again . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-17-059.wav|i will parody them . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-047.wav|but the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected , you think , said edmund . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-162.wav|and edmund , particularly struck by the alteration in fanny's looks , and from his ignorance of the daily evils of her father's house , attributing an undue share of the change , attributing all to the recent event , took her hand and said in a low but very expressive tone , no wonder , you must feel it ; you must suffer . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-33-26.wav|there was no bearing rein , no curb , nothing but a plain ring snaffle . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-42-04.wav|jerry , i've had mister b , here asking about your vote , and he wants to hire your cab for the election ; he will call for an answer . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-006.wav|the soup would be sent round in a most spiritless manner , wine drank without any smiles or agreeable trifling , and the venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of any former haunch , or a single entertaining story about my friend such a one . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-028.wav|the novelty was in their being lively . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-28-16.wav|besides , these drivers are often careless altogether , and will attend to anything else , rather than their horses . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-242.wav|but baddeley was stout . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-075.wav|as her appearance and spirits improved , sir thomas and missus norris thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan ; and it was pretty soon decided between them , that though far from clever , she showed a tractable disposition , and seemed likely to give them little trouble . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-41-23.wav|and the lady at number four in the crescent never orders her dinner till the meat comes in for lunch , and it's nothing but hurry , hurry , all the time . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-167.wav|the surprise of your refusal , fanny , seems to have been unbounded . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-46-28.wav|the rein was taken off , and in a moment i put my head down to my very knees . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-08-022.wav|she has time enough before her ; and her going now is quite out of the question . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-47-03.wav|i shall never forget my new master ; he had black eyes and a hooked nose , his mouth was as full of teeth as a bulldog's , and his voice was as harsh , as the grinding of cart wheels over graveled stones . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-039.wav|everything was by that time public beyond a hope . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-01-098.wav|very true , cried missus norris , which are both very important considerations ; and it will be just the same to miss lee whether she has three girls to teach , or only two , there can be no difference . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-057.wav|and after having twice drawn back her hand and twice attempted in vain , to turn away from him , she got up and said only with much agitation , do n't , mister crawford , pray don't !

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-194.wav|but on the contrary , it was no worse than , i am sorry to say that i am unable to answer your question .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-02-063.wav|she had been expecting to see him the whole morning , and all the evening , too , was still expecting him . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-149.wav|with undoubting decision she directly began her adieus . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-12-089.wav|i shall let a seven years' lease of everingham .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-04-105.wav|doctor grant laughingly congratulated miss crawford on feeling no disinclination to the state herself . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-160.wav|the consultation upon the play still went on , and miss crawford's attention was first called from fanny by tom bertram's telling her , with infinite regret , that he found it absolutely impossible for him to undertake the part of anhalt , in addition to the butler . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-022.wav|i understood that you had the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-046.wav|nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-018.wav|to fanny herself it appeared a very simple and natural circumstance . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-090.wav|my dear sir thomas ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-36-57.wav|you might as well say that our country's laws are not good because some people break them . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-19-38.wav|i was nearly mad when i came in and saw what was done . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-042.wav|there is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house , with one 's ideas of what such a household should be ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-178.wav|but though the conference had seemed full long to him , and though on looking at fanny he saw rather a flush of vexation , he inclined to hope that so much could not have been said and listened to , without some profit to the speaker . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-08-042.wav|and she found that the best of the three younger ones was gone in him : tom and charles being at least as many years as they were his juniors distant from that age of feeling and reason , which might suggest the expediency of making friends , and of endeavoring to be less disagreeable . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-16-063.wav|does not it strike you so , fanny ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-045.wav|many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-217.wav|time would undoubtedly abate somewhat of his sufferings , but still it was a sort of thing , which he never could get entirely the better of ; and as to his ever meeting with any other woman who could , it was too impossible to be named , but with indignation . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-10-043.wav|and as it was somehow or other ascertained or inferred , or at least acted upon , that they were not at all afraid , to the dockyard , they were all to go ; and but for mister crawford , mister price would have turned thither directly , without the smallest consideration for his daughters' errands in the high street . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-33-20.wav|do , she said , for i like to keep a good name going . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-08-067.wav|and as edmund and william were gone to northampton , and she had reason to think mister crawford likewise out , she walked down to the parsonage without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private discussion ; and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important part of it to fanny , being more than half-ashamed of her own solicitude . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-46-04.wav|i was sold to a corn dealer and baker , whom jerry knew , and with him he thought i should have good food and fair work . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-166.wav|my plan was laid at westminster , a little altered , perhaps , at cambridge , and at one-and-twenty executed .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-017.wav|this is not a very promising beginning , said missus norris , when fanny had left the room . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-32-27.wav|i could not help reaching out my head toward him . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-13-27.wav|i am much obliged to you , manly . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-25-13.wav|old max told me all this , for it happened a good while ago ; but shortly before ginger and i came , smith had been taken back again . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-036.wav|why should you dare say that ?

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-060.wav|that may be , sister , was all lady bertram's reply .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-059.wav|to say the truth , replied miss crawford , i am something like the famous doge at the court of lewis the fourteen ; and may declare that i see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-17-016.wav|he was not very solid ; but there was a hope of his becoming less trifling , of his being at least tolerably domestic and quiet ; and at any rate , there was comfort in finding his estate rather more and his debts much less than he had feared , and in being consulted and treated as the friend best worth attending to . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-12-007.wav|and his indifference was so much more than equalled by her own , that were he now to step forth the owner of mansfield park , the sir thomas complete , which he was to be in time , she did not believe she could accept him .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-24-89.wav|there was a great deal of hurry and excitement after the news became known .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-38-13.wav|he never went to the rising sun ; there was a coffee shop near , where he now and then went , or he bought of an old man , who came to our rank with tins of hot coffee and pies .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-077.wav|what could be more natural than that edmund should be making himself useful , and proving his good-nature by anyone ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-06-110.wav|he was roused from the reverie of retrospection and regret produced by it , by some inquiry from edmund as to his plans for the next day's hunting ; and he found it was as well to be a man of fortune at once with horses , and grooms at his command . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-36-39.wav|we have known what it was to have no sundays , and now we know what it is to call them our own . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-08-017.wav|she will have a companion in fanny price , you know , so it will all do very well ; and as for edmund , as he is not here to speak for himself , i will answer for his being most happy to join the party . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-36-41.wav|god forbid that we should ever turn back to those times . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-35-56.wav|take this extra half-crown . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-12-15.wav|the words were scarcely out of his mouth when there was a groan , and a crack , and a splitting sound , and tearing , crashing down among the other trees came an oak , torn up by the roots , and it fell right across the road just before us . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-01-013.wav|she could hardly have made a more untoward choice . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-049.wav|there was a charm , perhaps , in his sincerity , his steadiness , his integrity , which miss crawford might be equal to feel , though not equal to discuss with herself . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-136.wav|if i were to undertake it , i should only disappoint you . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-39-36.wav|jerry had taken no part in this conversation , but i never saw his face look so sad before . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-001.wav|chapter four . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-36-18.wav|i read that god made man , and he made horses and all the other beasts , and as soon as he had made them he made a day of rest , and bade that all should rest one day in seven ; and i think , sir , he must have known what was good for them , and i am sure it is good for me ; i am stronger and healthier altogether , now that i have a day of rest ; the horses are fresh too , and do not wear up nearly so fast . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-10-27.wav|for fashion ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-022.wav|we have been looking for you this half-hour . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-032.wav|very soon after the rushworths' return to wimpole street , sir thomas had received a letter from an old , and most particular friend in london , who hearing and witnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter , wrote to recommend sir thomas 's coming to london himself , and using his influence with his daughter , to put an end to the intimacy , which was already exposing her to unpleasant remarks , and evidently making mister rushworth uneasy . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-074.wav|such a match as miss bertram has made is a public blessing ; for the first pleasures of mister rushworth's wife must be to fill her house , and give the best balls in the country . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-046.wav|fanny read to herself that , it was with infinite concern the newspaper had to announce to the world , a matrimonial fracas in the family of mister r of wimpole street . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-45-30.wav|at noon he came again and gave us our food and water . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-34-37.wav|my master , my dear master , was cheering on his comrades with his right arm raised on high , when one of the balls whizzing close to my head struck him . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-039.wav|miss crawford listened ; and all her intended compliments and insinuations to fanny were forgotten : she felt only one thing ; and her eyes , bright as they had been before , showing they could yet be brighter , she exclaimed with eager pleasure , did he ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-133.wav|she could not do entirely without any ; she must have something to write about , even to her niece ; and being so soon to lose all the benefit of doctor grant's gouty symptoms , and missus grant 's morning calls , it was very hard upon her to be deprived of one of the last epistolary uses she could put them to . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-06-16.wav|i ought to say that sometimes we had our liberty for a few hours ; this used to be on fine sundays in the summer-time . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-114.wav|within the room all was tranquil enough , for susan having disappeared with the others , there were soon only her father and herself remaining ; and he , taking out a newspaper , the accustomary loan of a neighbor , applied himself to studying it without seeming to recollect her existence . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-073.wav|the place deserves it , and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less , than it is capable of . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-184.wav|she wished to be able to decline it ; but the tears , which a variety of feelings created , made it easier to swallow than to speak . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-11-073.wav|yes ; when you give me your opinion , i always know what is right . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-141.wav|miss crawford civilly wished him an early promotion . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-088.wav|from being the mere gentleman's residence , it becomes , by judicious improvement , the residence of a man of education , taste , modern manners , good connexions . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-126.wav|she would do her best . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-004.wav|the living was hereafter for edmund ; and had his uncle died a few years sooner , it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-13-098.wav|these were not expressions to do fanny any good ; for though she read in too much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of miss crawford's meaning , it was evident that she meant to compliment her on her brother's attachment , and even to appear to believe it serious . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-34-16.wav|we always liked to hear the trumpet sound , and to be called out , and were impatient to start off , though sometimes we had to stand for hours , waiting for the word of command ; and when the word was given we used to spring forward as gayly and eagerly , as if there were no cannon balls , bayonets , or bullets . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-164.wav|it is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest , who loves you most devotedly , that has the best right to a return . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-11-042.wav|no , my dear miss price , and for reasons good . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-021.wav|she immediately shook her head at fanny with arch , yet affectionate reproach , and taking her hand , seemed hardly able to help beginning directly . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-028.wav|it would be lucky for me if i had nothing but the executive part to do ; you , are the best off , i can tell you . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-183.wav|he spoke calmly , however , without austerity , without reproach , and she revived a little . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-004.wav|the neatness and propriety of her dress was all that he would allow himself to commend in her presence , but upon her leaving the room again soon afterwards , he spoke of her beauty with very decided praise . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-192.wav|fanny's interest seems in safer hands with you than with me . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-45-36.wav|i wouldn't go to the house , my boy , he said , but i want to know how your father is . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-137.wav|she was then , out . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-12-37.wav|the bridge is broken in the middle , and part of it is carried away ; if you come on you'll be into the river . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-102.wav|she could not come . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-09-102.wav|you look tired and fagged , fanny . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-063.wav|and i have two or three ideas also , said edmund , and one of them is that very little of your plan for thornton lacey will ever be put in practice . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-107.wav|and you must be aware , fanny , that it is every young woman 's duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-125.wav|i can not intend anything , which it must be so completely beyond my power to command . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-04-099.wav|i consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet , heaven's last best gift . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-093.wav|edmund was the first to speak . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-104.wav|as for fanny's being stupid at learning , she could only say it was very unlucky , but some people were stupid , and fanny must take more pains : she did not know what else was to be done ; and except her being so dull , she must add , she saw no harm in the poor little thing , and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages , and fetching what she wanted . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-065.wav|i know he spoke to you yesterday , and as far as i understand received as much encouragement to proceed as a well-judging young woman could permit herself to give . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-20-52.wav|john laughed , and said he had grown an inch taller in that week , and i believe he had . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-065.wav|i know nobody who distinguishes characters better . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-041.wav|i think too well of miss bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-146.wav|i should not have mentioned the subject , though very anxious to know her sentiments . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-197.wav|she feared she had been doing wrong : saying too much , overacting the caution , which she had been fancying necessary ; in guarding against one evil , laying herself open to another ; and to have miss crawford 's liveliness repeated to her at such a moment , and on such a subject , was a bitter aggravation . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-15-12.wav|the head hostler was a pleasant , active little man , with a crooked leg , and a yellow striped waistcoat . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-160.wav|and yet i do not think i am a very difficult mistress to please . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-161.wav|susan was her only companion and listener on this , as on more common occasions . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-12-034.wav|she was privy , one evening , to the hopes of her aunt norris on the subject , as well as to her feelings , and the feelings of missus rushworth , on a point of some similarity , and could not help wondering as she listened ; and glad would she have been not to be obliged to listen . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-02-051.wav|and sir thomas was in hopes that another day or two would suffice , to wipe away every outward memento of what had been , even to the destruction of every unbound copy of lovers' vows in the house , for he was burning all that met his eye . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-10-045.wav|they were then to set forward for the dockyard at once , and the walk would have been conducted according to mister crawford 's opinion in a singular manner , had mister price been allowed the entire regulation of it , as the two girls , he found , would have been left to follow and keep up with them , or not as they could while they walked on together at their own hasty pace . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-082.wav|oh dear , no , ma'am , nobody suspected you ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-133.wav|look so to all the others , but not to him ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-065.wav|fanny was not in the secret of her uncle's feelings , sir thomas not in the secret of miss crawford's character . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-101.wav|in the drawing room miss crawford was also celebrated . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-119.wav|did she think of being up before you set off ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-016.wav|i did not see that ; i should not know one from the other . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-116.wav|mister rushworth was worked on . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-096.wav|no objection was made , but for some time there seemed no inclination to move in any plan , or to any distance . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-17-54.wav|cheer up , you'll make friends there ; and if you get on well , as i am sure you will , it will be a fine thing for your mother , and she will be proud enough that you have got into such a good place as that . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-06-042.wav|this it is , her not caring about you , which gives her such a soft skin , and makes her so much taller , and produces all these charms and graces ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-10-021.wav|by the time he had given all this information it was not unreasonable to suppose , that fanny might be looked at and spoken to . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-008.wav|she had done no more for them than they had done for each other . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-135.wav|he would have taken no pains to be on terms with missus rushworth again . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-063.wav|a letter exposes to all the evil of consultation , and where the mind is anything short of perfect decision , an adviser may , in an unlucky moment , lead it to do what it may afterwards regret . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-014.wav|she had not spirits to notice her in more than a few repulsive looks , but she felt her as a spy , an intruder , and an indigent niece and everything most odious . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-23-31.wav|ginger was never put into the carriage again , but when she was well of her bruises one of lord w's younger sons said he should like to have her ; he was sure she would make a good hunter . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-18-42.wav|the man at the toll-gate had it open . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-44-47.wav|i can do with high spirits , said jerry , if a horse is not vicious or hard-mouthed . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-24-73.wav|he unbuttoned her habit , loosened her collar , felt her hands and wrist , then started up and looked wildly round him for help . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-02-069.wav|a few moments of feverish enjoyment were followed by hours of acute suffering . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-36-74.wav|tis not for me to lay down plans for other people , said jerry , but if they can't walk so far they can go to what is nearer . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-071.wav|not i , indeed , i have had enough of the family for one morning . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-068.wav|i wonder what she thinks of my father ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-20-20.wav|i can not say if john would have approved of our pace , but joe and i were both of one mind , and so angry that we could not have gone slower . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-14-06.wav|good-morning , john , said the master . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-33-19.wav|we'll call him jack , after the old one , shall we , polly ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-035.wav|if i did not believe that she had some regard for me , of course i should not say this , but i do believe it .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-109.wav|he was , perhaps , but at treacherous play with her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-177.wav|fanny had scarcely passed the solemn-looking servants , when lady bertram came from the drawing room to meet her ; came with no indolent step ; and falling on her neck , said , dear fanny ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-02-26.wav|now we shall see the hare , said my mother ; and just then a hare wild with fright rushed by and made for the plantation . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-03-01.wav|chapter three . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-097.wav|by convincing her that fanny was very pretty , which she had been doubting about before , and that she would be advantageously married , it made her feel a sort of credit in calling her niece . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-153.wav|missus norris could not speak with any temper of such grievances , nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly consumed in the house . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-17-070.wav|if you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is henry , for a time . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-122.wav|her curiosity was all awake , and she ran through it with an eagerness , which was suspended only by intervals of astonishment , that it could be chosen in the present instance , that it could be proposed and accepted in a private theater ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-44-56.wav|however , the next day , after five or six hours in the cab , he came in quiet and sensible . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-24-72.wav|but there was no answer . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-184.wav|i can not be dictated to by a watch . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-122.wav|there is a beauty in every family ; it is a regular thing . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-12-060.wav|those who have not more must be satisfied with what they have . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-12-061.wav|oh no , you can not . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-12-088.wav|i shall let everingham , and rent a place in this neighborhood perhaps , stanwix lodge . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-064.wav|and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise , something was probably added in edmund's attendance and instructions , and something more in the conviction of very much surpassing her sex in general by her early progress , to make her unwilling to dismount . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-120.wav|her mind was quite determined , and varied not . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-29-89.wav|two gentlemen came out ; the taller of them came round to my head ; he looked at the bit and bridle , and just shifted the collar with his hand to see if it fitted comfortably . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-21-19.wav|john had the offer of several good places , but he said he should wait a little and look around . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-35-03.wav|i never knew a better man than my new master . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-040.wav|her father's house would , in all probability , teach her the value of a good income ; and he trusted that she would be the wiser and happier woman all her life , for the experiment he had devised . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-30-24.wav|why , this is only august ; and with your light work and good food , he ought not to go down like this , even if it was autumn . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-072.wav|my plan may not be the best possible : i had not many minutes to form it in ; but you must do a good deal . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-092.wav|the count has two-and-forty speeches , returned mister rushworth , which is no trifle . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-013.wav|if i must give my opinion , i have always thought it the most insipid play in the english language . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-41-14.wav|after looking at the horse , he turned angrily to the lad . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-02-06.wav|the oldest of the colts raised his head , pricked his ears , and said , there are the hounds ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-060.wav|now , at sotherton , we have a good seven hundred without reckoning the water meadows ; so that i think , if so much could be done at compton , we need not despair . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-056.wav|you have given us an amusing sketch , and human nature can not say it was not so . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-12-006.wav|i have not time for writing much , but it would be out of place if i had , for this is to be a mere letter of business , penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information , which could not be delayed without risk of evil . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-39-40.wav|it was the look in that horse's eye that came over me . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-013.wav|i wish you could see compton , said he ; it is the most complete thing ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-31-21.wav|yes , sir , i will . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-37-13.wav|on sunday morning jerry was cleaning me in the yard , when polly stepped up to him , looking very full of something . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-29-32.wav|the other horse was thrown upon his haunches , and one shaft broken . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-06-039.wav|her looks say , i will not like you , i am determined not to like you ; and i say , she shall . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-08-045.wav|there can be no objection then to fanny's going with you . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-119.wav|or why had not she rather gone to her own room , as she had felt to be safest , instead of attending the rehearsal at all ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-041.wav|oh , cousin ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-016.wav|the approach now is one of the finest things in the country . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-24-88.wav|no , no , he said ; i'll be back to em again by a short cut through the fields , and be there afore the carriage . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-49-48.wav|after this it was quite decided to keep me , and call me by my old name of black beauty . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-15-08.wav|all these little things help a horse very much , particularly if he gets kind words into the bargain . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-071.wav|she wondered that edmund should forget her , and felt a pang . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-30-10.wav|for a few days all went on well . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-013.wav|and he directly saw a knoll not half a mile off , which would give them exactly the requisite command of the house . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-07-46.wav|he came quietly along , now and then shaking the oats about that he had in the sieve , and speaking cheerfully and gently to me : come along , lassie , come along , lassie ; come along , come along . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-031.wav|i came to rehearse . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-11-040.wav|this will not do . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-08-120.wav|he evidently tried to please her : he was gallant , he was attentive , he was something like what he had been to her cousins : he wanted , she supposed , to cheat her of her tranquillity as he had cheated them ; and whether he might not have some concern in this necklace , she could not be convinced that he had not , for miss crawford , complaisant as a sister , was careless as a woman and a friend . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-178.wav|if she had been riding before , i should not have asked it of her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-079.wav|sitting with her on sunday evening , a wet sunday evening , the very time of all others when if a friend is at hand , the heart must be opened , and everything told . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-12-046.wav|to be deriving support from the commendations of missus fraser ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-165.wav|perhaps , turning to miss crawford , my other companion may do me the honor of taking an arm . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-135.wav|but i am not fishing ; do n't compliment me . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-06-109.wav|the wish was rather eager than lasting . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-43-45.wav|as jerry went to open the door , two men , with colors in their hats and buttonholes , ran up calling out , cab ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-12-067.wav|fanny's beauty of face and figure , fanny's graces of manner and goodness of heart , were the exhaustless theme . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-063.wav|fanny wrote to offer herself ; and her mother's answer , though short , was so kind , a few simple lines expressed so natural and motherly a joy in the prospect of seeing her child again , as to confirm all the daughter's views of happiness in being with her , convincing her that she should now find a warm and affectionate friend in the mama , who had certainly shown no remarkable fondness for her formerly ; but this she could easily suppose to have been her own fault or her own fancy . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-16-11.wav|the trapdoor had been left open , and i thought that was the place it came through . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-010.wav|in the evening it was found , according to the predetermination of missus grant and her sister , that after making up the whist table , there would remain sufficient for a round game , and everybody being as perfectly complying , and without a choice as on such occasions they always are , speculation was decided on almost as soon as whist ; and lady bertram soon found herself in the critical situation of being applied to , for her own choice between the games , and being required either to draw a card for whist or not . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-100.wav|after another pause he went on , pray , miss price , are you such a great admirer of this mister crawford as some people are ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-040.wav|she was in a reverie of sweet remembrances . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-15-17.wav|well , he said , i thought i was pretty quick , and our john quicker still , but you do beat all i ever saw for being quick and thorough at the same time . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-122.wav|now and then , i should hope to have a friend in my little cottage . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-105.wav|the politeness , which she had been brought up to practice as a duty , made it impossible for her to escape ; while the want of that higher species of self-command , that just consideration of others , that knowledge of her own heart , that principle of right , which had not formed any essential part of her education , made her miserable under it . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-16-005.wav|miss crawford had protected her only for the time ; and if she were applied to again among themselves with all the authoritative urgency that tom and maria were capable of , and edmund perhaps away , what should she do ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-093.wav|is not she to live with you ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-49-22.wav|handsome is that handsome does , said my master ; you are only taking him on trial , and i am sure you will do fairly by him , young man . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-03-124.wav|nay , nay , i entreat you ; for one moment , put down your work . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-142.wav|his great object was to be off as soon as possible . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-118.wav|i mean to be too rich , to lament , or to feel anything of the sort . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-03-071.wav|she is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about , and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-08-118.wav|it was impossible for her to be insensible of mister crawford 's change of manners . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-048.wav|she felt it to be so , though she had not foreseen , and could hardly understand it ; for he was not pleasant by any common rule : he talked no nonsense ; he paid no compliments ; his opinions were unbending , his attentions tranquil and simple . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-180.wav|but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself , giving it every reproach , but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency , and impudence in wrong ; and last of all and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence , in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as i now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-24-12.wav|when we came to the door the gentleman seemed very uneasy . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-071.wav|the house is always in confusion . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-081.wav|miss crawford , rallying her spirits and recovering her complexion , replied only , if i had known this before , i would have spoken of the cloth with more respect , and turned the subject . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-114.wav|so soon , my good friend , said sir thomas , producing his watch with all necessary caution ; it is three o'clock , and your sister is not used to these sort of hours . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-09-041.wav|susan saw that much was wrong at home and wanted to set it right . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-17-082.wav|edmund , between his theatrical and his real part , between miss crawford's claims and his own conduct , between love and consistency was equally unobservant . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-042.wav|to do him justice , however , he did not resolve to appropriate it ; for remembering that there was some very good ranting ground in frederick , he professed an equal willingness for that . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-06-170.wav|you can never want employment . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-06-046.wav|i only want her to look kindly on me , to give me smiles as well as blushes , to keep a chair for me by herself , wherever we are , and be all animation when i take it and talk to her ; to think as i think , be interested in all my possessions and pleasures , try to keep me longer at mansfield , and feel when i go away that she shall be never happy again . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-14-061.wav|it was weeks since she had heard anything of miss crawford , or of her other connexions in town , except through mansfield .
