../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-044.wav|sir thomas , however , remained yet a little longer in town , in the hope of discovering and snatching her from farther vice , though all was lost on the side of character .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-01-089.wav|for the present , the danger was over , and fanny's sick feelings subsided . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-163.wav|you must now come downstairs with me . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-111.wav|and the job was to be done as well as it could in a great hurry ; william trying in vain to send betsey down again or keep her from being troublesome where she was ; the whole of which , as almost every door in the house was open , could be plainly distinguished in the parlor , except when drowned at intervals by the superior noise of sam , tom , and charles , chasing each other up and down stairs , and tumbling about and hallooing . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-10-061.wav|by taking a circuitous route , and as it appeared to her , very unreasonable direction to the knoll , they were soon beyond her eye ; and for some minutes longer she remained without sight or sound of any companion .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-054.wav|when he had really resolved on any measure , he could always carry it through ; and now by dint of long talking on the subject , explaining and dwelling on the duty of fanny's sometimes seeing her family , he did induce his wife to let her go ; obtaining it rather from submission , however , than conviction , for lady bertram was convinced of very little more , than that sir thomas thought fanny ought to go , and therefore that she must .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-006.wav|this was the letter : a most scandalous , ill-natured rumor has just reached me , and i write , dear fanny , to warn you against giving the least credit to it , should it spread into the country .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-11-007.wav|fanny's disposition was such that she could never even think of her aunt norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her own small house , without reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her , when they had been last together ; much less could her feelings acquit her of having done and said and thought everything by william that was due to him for a whole fortnight . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-49-42.wav|miss ellen was going to try me , and green went with her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-175.wav|she had no one to take her part , to counsel , or speak for her .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-08-041.wav|there is no hardship , i suppose , nothing unpleasant , said edmund , in going on the barouche box .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-089.wav|a friendship between two so very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished : and to the credit of the lover's understanding , be it stated , that he did not by any means consider fanny as the only , or even as the greater gainer by such a friendship .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-47-17.wav|it was a very heavy train , and as all the cabs were soon engaged , ours was called for . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-113.wav|but if they are so much fonder of her than she is of them , she is the less likely to have been hurt , except by their flattery . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-01-225.wav|as a general reflection on fanny , sir thomas thought nothing could be more unjust , though he had been so lately expressing the same sentiments himself , and he tried to turn the conversation , tried repeatedly before he could succeed ; for missus norris had not discernment enough to perceive , either now , or at any other time , to what degree he thought well of his niece , or how very far he was from wishing to have his own children's merits set off by the depreciation of hers . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-065.wav|i think the house and premises may be made comfortable , and given the air of a gentleman's residence , without any very heavy expense , and that must suffice me ; and i hope , may suffice all who care about me . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-02-014.wav|love such as his , in a man like himself , must with perseverance secure a return , and at no great distance ; and he had so much delight in the idea of obliging her to love him in a very short time , that her not loving him now was scarcely regretted .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-08-04.wav|after my breaking in , she said , i was bought by a dealer to match another chestnut horse .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-12-134.wav|what can sir thomas and edmund together do , what do they do for her happiness , comfort , honor , and dignity in the world , to what i shall do ? 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-14-120.wav|edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman , it seemed , under certain conditions of wealth ; and this , she suspected , was all the conquest of prejudice , which he was so ready to congratulate himself upon .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-110.wav|tom walked out of the room as he said it , and edmund was left to sit down and stir the fire , in thoughtful vexation .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-09-038.wav|every generation has its improvements , said miss crawford , with a smile , to edmund . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-146.wav|anxious not to appear unhappy , she soon recovered herself ; and wiping away her tears , was able to notice and admire all the striking parts of his dress ; listening with reviving spirits to his cheerful hopes of being on shore some part of every day before they sailed , and even of getting her to spithead to see the sloop . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-44-39.wav|i know there's two or three would like to keep out of that tavern if they could . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-03-027.wav|i believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were , than assuming a new character . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-048.wav|connected as we already are , and i hope are to be , to give up mary crawford would be to give up the society of some of those most dear to me ; to banish myself from the very houses and friends , whom under any other distress i should turn to for consolation . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-13-004.wav|these were the contents : mansfield park , my dear fanny , excuse me that i have not written before . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-020.wav|it required a longer time , however , than missus norris was inclined to allow , to reconcile fanny to the novelty of mansfield park , and the separation from everybody she had been used to . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-05-190.wav|miss crawford could have said that there would be a something to do , and to suffer for it , which she could not think lightly of ; but she checked herself and let it pass ; and tried to look calm and unconcerned , when the two gentlemen shortly afterwards joined them . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-074.wav|not but that she was really pleased to have fanny admired ; but she was so much more struck with her own kindness in sending chapman to her , that she could not get it out of her head . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-158.wav|and when , from taking notice of her work , and wishing she could work as well , and begging for the pattern , and supposing fanny was now preparing for her appearance , as of course she would come out when her cousin was married , miss crawford proceeded to inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea , and said that she had quite a curiosity to see him , and imagined him a very fine young man , and advised fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea again . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-01-048.wav|my dear sir thomas , i perfectly comprehend you , and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions , which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-45-06.wav|i wonder if the beautiful ladies ever think of the weary cabman waiting on his box , and his patient beast standing till his legs get stiff with cold . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-124.wav|miss bertram was the one . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-078.wav|i am so glad your eldest cousin is gone , that he may be mister bertram again . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-053.wav|fanny felt for him most acutely . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-12-018.wav|fanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-141.wav|i was quiet , but i was not blind . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-21-51.wav|very soon the train came puffing up into the station ; then two or three minutes , and the doors were slammed to , the guard whistled , and the train glided away , leaving behind it only clouds of white smoke and some very heavy hearts . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-10-083.wav|now , i must apply to you for information . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-11-099.wav|not considering in how different a circle she had been just seeing him , nor how much might be owing to contrast , she was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle , and regardful of others than formerly . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-02-030.wav|he was putting on his wig , so i said , coachman , you had much better not go ; your lady and i shall be very safe ; you know how steady stephen is , and charles has been upon the leaders so often now , that i am sure there is no fear . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-146.wav|i repeat again , added sir thomas , that thornton lacey is the only house in the neighborhood , in which i should not be happy to wait on mister crawford as occupier . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-14-099.wav|without attending to this , henry crawford continued his supplication . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-12-46.wav|i could not understand much of what they said , but i found they thought , if i had gone on as the master wanted me , most likely the bridge would have given way under us , and horse , chaise , master , and man would have fallen into the river ; and as the current was flowing very strongly , and there was no light and no help at hand , it was more than likely we should all have been drowned . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-11-015.wav|the day was uncommonly lovely . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-10-20.wav|i exclaimed . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-109.wav|i see things very differently now . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-10-046.wav|he was able to introduce some improvement occasionally , though by no means to the extent he wished ; he absolutely would not walk away from them ; and at any crossing or any crowd , when mister price was only calling out , come , girls ; come , fan ; come , sue , take care of yourselves ; keep a sharp lookout ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-15-021.wav|she had begun to think he really loved her , and to fancy his affection for her something more than common ; and his sister still said that he cared for nobody else . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-45-18.wav|at a quarter past one the door opened , and the two gentlemen came out ; they got into the cab without a word , and told jerry where to drive , that was nearly two miles . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-06-078.wav|she proclaimed her thoughts . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-08-013.wav|i charge you , take care of fanny . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-34-27.wav|then one of the officers rode up , and gave the word for the men to mount , and in a second every man was in his saddle , and every horse stood expecting the touch of the rein , or the pressure of his rider's heels , all animated , all eager ; but still we had been trained so well , that except by the champing of our bits , and the restive tossing of our heads from time to time , it could not be said that we stirred . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-28-25.wav|whether the man was partly blind or only very careless i can't say , but he drove me with that stone in my foot for a good half mile before he saw anything . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-33-52.wav|some grooms will go home to their beer and leave us for hours with our dry hay and oats , and nothing to moisten them ; then of course we gulp down too much at once , which helps to spoil our breathing and sometimes chills our stomachs . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-05-129.wav|oh , miss crawford , that was not fair . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-04-085.wav|he sees difficulties nowhere : and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-04-033.wav|fanny felt that she must ; and though she had not waited for that sentence to be thinking of edmund , such a memento made her particularly awake to his idea , and she fancied him sitting in that room again and again , perhaps in the very spot where she sat now , listening with constant delight to the favorite air , played , as it appeared to her , with superior tone and expression . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-18-052.wav|and if he were , i do not think i could go through it with him , till i have hardened myself a little ; for really there is a speech or two . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-177.wav|oh , then the point is clear . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-18-38.wav|take care of him , sir , if you can ; i should not like any harm to come to him . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-16-45.wav|shouted two or three voices , stand back , make way ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-07-083.wav|by god , i wish you may ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-47-33.wav|the suddenness and the force with which i fell seemed to beat all the breath out of my body . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-07-006.wav|she entertains me ; and she is so extremely pretty , that i have great pleasure in looking at her . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-13-12.wav|it may be , said he to himself , that young fellow is a liar as well as a cruel one ; we'll just go home by farmer bushby 's , beauty , and then if anybody wants to know you and i can tell em , ye see . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-47-56.wav|when the twelfth day after the accident came , i was taken to the sale , a few miles out of london . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-32-22.wav|i looked after him , but he was gone , and a very hard-looking , loud-voiced man came . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-36-12.wav|i should be glad to oblige the lady , sir , but i had a seven-days' license once , and the work was too hard for me , and too hard for my horses . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-02-063.wav|he talked to her more , and from all that she said , was convinced of her having an affectionate heart , and a strong desire of doing right ; and he could perceive her to be farther entitled to attention , by great sensibility of her situation and great timidity . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-17-088.wav|all that followed was the result of her imprudence ; and he went off with her at last , because he could not help it , regretting fanny even at the moment , but regretting her infinitely more , when all the bustle of the intrigue was over , and a very few months had taught him , by the force of contrast , to place a yet higher value on the sweetness of her temper , the purity of her mind , and the excellence of her principles . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-47-45.wav|in the evening i was sufficiently recovered to be led back to skinner's stables , where i think they did the best for me they could . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-09-054.wav|they were decided . 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-05-164.wav|but i afterwards found that i had been giving all my attention to the youngest , who was not out , and had most excessively offended the eldest .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-15-145.wav|and before she could breathe after it , missus norris completed the whole , by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible : what a piece of work here is about nothing : i am quite ashamed of you , fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort , so kind as they are to you ! 
../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-196.wav|i had gone a few steps , fanny , when i heard the door open behind me .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-BB-13-38.wav|then he talked to all the boys very seriously about cruelty , and said how hard-hearted and cowardly it was to hurt the weak and the helpless ; but what stuck in my mind was this , he said that cruelty was the devil's own trade-mark , and if we saw any one who took pleasure in cruelty we might know who he belonged to , for the devil was a murderer from the beginning , and a tormentor to the end .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP1-13-097.wav|to everything of that nature i will be answerable , said tom , in a decided tone .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP2-07-078.wav|that will be done by the removal of the farmyard ; for independent of that terrible nuisance , i never saw a house of the kind , which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman's residence , so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage house , above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year .

../database/blizzard2013/segmented/wavn/CA-MP3-16-211.wav|fanny , now at liberty to speak openly , felt more than justified in adding to his knowledge of her real character , by some hint of what share his brother's state of health might be supposed to have in her wish for a complete reconciliation .
